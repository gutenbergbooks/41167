<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This volume treats of five of the early
campaigns in the portion of America
known as the Mississippi Basin&mdash;Clark&rsquo;s
campaigns against Kaskaskia and
Vincennes in 1778 and 1779; and Harmar&rsquo;s,
St. Clair&rsquo;s, and Wayne&rsquo;s campaigns against
the northwestern Indians in 1790, 1791,
and 1793-94.</p>

<p>Much as has been written concerning
Clark&rsquo;s famous march through the &ldquo;drowned
lands of the Wabash,&rdquo; the important question
of his route has been untouched, and
the story from that standpoint untold.
The history of the campaign is here made
subservient to a study of the route and to
an attempted identification of the various
places, and a determination of their present-day
names. Four volumes of the Draper
Manuscripts in the library of the State
Historical Society of Wisconsin give a vast
deal of information on this subject. They
are referred to by the library press-mark.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>Turning to the study of Harmar&rsquo;s, St.
Clair&rsquo;s, and Wayne&rsquo;s routes into the Northwest,
the author found a singular lack of
detailed description of these campaigns,
and determined to combine with the study
of the military roadway a comparatively
complete sketch of each campaign, making
use, in this case as in that of Clark&rsquo;s campaigns,
of the Draper Manuscripts.</p>

<p>A great debt of thanks is due to Mr.
Reuben Gold Thwaites, Secretary of the
State Historical Society of Wisconsin, for
assistance and advice; to Josiah Morrow of
Lebanon, Ohio, the author is indebted for
help in determining portions of Harmar&rsquo;s
route; and to Francis E. Wilson, President
of the Greenville Historical Society, many
thanks are due for help in questions concerning
the pathway of the intrepid leader
known to the East as &ldquo;Mad Anthony&rdquo;
Wayne, but remembered in the West as
the &ldquo;Blacksnake&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Whirlwind,&rdquo;
because he doubled his track like a blacksnake
and swept over his roads like a
whirlwind.</p>

<h3>THE CLARK ROUTES THROUGH ILLINOIS</h3>


<p>On the twenty-fourth of June, 1778,
George Rogers Clark, with about
one hundred and seventy-five patriot
adventurers, left the little pioneer settlement
on Corn Island, in the Ohio River,
opposite the present site of Louisville,
Kentucky, for the conquest of the British
posts of Kaskaskia and Vincennes in the
&ldquo;Illinois country.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The boats running day and night, the
party reached Clark&rsquo;s first stopping-place,
an island in the Ohio near the mouth of the
Tennessee River, in four days. Just below
this island was the site of old Fort Massac&mdash;now
occupied by Metropolis, Massac County,
Illinois&mdash;built probably by a vanguard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
from Fort Duquesne, a generation before,
when the French clearly foresaw the end
of their reign on the upper Ohio. Here,
almost a century before that, was the old
trading-station of Juchereau and the mission
of Mermet&mdash;the subsequent &ldquo;soul of
the mission of Kaskaskia,&rdquo; as Bancroft
describes him. The situation was strategic
on two accounts: it was a site well out of
the reach of the Ohio floods, and it was
near the mouths of both the Tennessee and
Cumberland Rivers&mdash;valleys known of old
to the Shawanese and Cherokees. As a
coign of vantage for traders and missionaries,
it had been of commanding importance.
It was, likewise, near the Ohio
terminus of several old buffalo routes across
Illinois, roads which became connecting
links between Kaskaskia, on the river
bearing that name near the Mississippi, and
the mission at Fort Massac. The old paths
of the buffalo, long known as hunting
traces, offered the traveler from the Ohio
to the old-time metropolis of Illinois a
short-cut by land, saving thrice the distance
by water, and obviated stemming the swift
tides of the Mississippi. One of the prin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>cipal
backbones of Illinois was threaded by
these primeval routes, and high ground
between the vast cypress swamps and mist-crowned
drowned lands of Illinois was a
boon to any traveler, especially that first
traveler, the bison. This high ground ran
between Kaskaskia and Shawneetown, on
the Ohio River, the course becoming later
a famous state highway. Its earliest name
was the &ldquo;Kaskaskia Trace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clark&rsquo;s spies, sent out to Illinois a year
before, undoubtedly advised him to land at
Fort Massac and, gaining from there this
famous highway, to pursue it to Kaskaskia.
His plan of surprising the British post
necessitated his pursuing unexpected
courses. It was well known that the British
watched the Mississippi well; therefore
he chose the land route. Here, at the mouth
of the Tennessee, his men brought in a
canoe full of white traders who had recently
been in Kaskaskia; certain of these were
engaged to guide Clark thither. The
party dropped down to Massac Creek, which
enters the Ohio just above the site of the
old fort, and in that inlet secreted their
flat-boats ready to begin their intrepid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
march of one hundred and twenty miles
across country.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>As this little company of eight or nine
score adventurers drew around their fires
on Massac Creek, they little dreamed, we
may be sure, of the fame they were to gain
from this plucky excursion into the prairies
of Illinois. It was impossible for them to
lift their eyes above the commonplaces of
the journey and the possibilities of the
coming encounter, and see in true perspective
what the capture of Illinois meant to
poor Kentucky. It is not less difficult for
us to turn our eyes from these general
results, which were so brilliant, and get a
clear insight into the commonplaces of this
memorable little campaign&mdash;to hear the
talk of the tired men about the fires as they
cleaned the heavy clods of mud from shoes
and moccasins, examined their guns, viewed
the night, and then talked softly of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
possibilities of the morrow, and dreamed,
in the ruddy firelight, of those at home.
Of all companies of famous campaigners on
the Indian trails of America, this company
was the smallest and the most picturesque.
Clark had but little over half the force
which Washington commanded at Fort
Necessity in 1754.</p>

<p>Little Massac Creek is eleven miles in
length but drains seventy square miles of
territory. This fact is a significant description
of the nature of the northern and central
portions of Massac County. From the
Cache River a string of lakes extends in a
southeast and then northeast direction to
Big Bay River, varying in width from one
to four miles; around the lakes lies a much
greater area of cypress swamps and treacherous
&ldquo;sloughs&rdquo; altogether impassable.
The water of these lakes drains sometimes
into the Cache and at other times into the
Big Bay&mdash;depending upon the stage of
water in the Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>There were three routes from Fort Massac
toward Kaskaskia; one, which may well
be called the Moccasin Gap route, circled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
to the eastward to get around the lakes and
swamps of Massac County; it passed eastward
into Pope County, where it struck the
Kaskaskia-Shawneetown highway. This
route ran two and one-half miles west of
Golconda, Pope County, and on to Sulphur
or Round Spring. From thence through
Moccasin Gap, section 3, township 12,
range 4E, Johnson County; thence it ran
directly for the prairie country to the
northward. As noted, this route merged
into the famous old Kaskaskia and Shawneetown
route across Illinois&mdash;what was
known as the Kaskaskia Trace&mdash;in Pope
County. It was this course which in earliest
times had been blazed by the French
as the safest common highway between
Kaskaskia and the trading and mission
station (and later fort) at Massac. The
trees along the course were marked with
the proper number of miles by means of a
hot iron, the figures then being painted red.
&ldquo;Such I saw them,&rdquo; records Governor
Reynolds, &ldquo;in 1800. This road made a
great curve to the north to avoid the
swamps and rough country on the sources
of the Cash [Cache] river, and also to obtain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the prairie country as soon as possible.
This road ... was called the old Massac
road by the Americans.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">SKETCH MAP <small>OF PART OF</small> ILLINOIS</span>
<p class="center">Showing Routes of George Rogers Clark</p>
</div>

<p>The second route circled the Massac
County lakes to the westward, cutting in
between them and the canyons of the Cache
River, near what is familiarly known as
Indian Point (section 33, township 13, range
3E, Massac County), or one mile south of
the northwest corner of Massac County;
thence, running north of northwest, it
crossed the Little Cache (Dutchman&rsquo;s
Creek) one and one-half miles north of
Forman. Thence the route is up the east
side of the Cache and through Buffalo Gap,
section 25, township 11, range 2E, Johnson
County, to the prairie land beyond. The
third route follows the second through Massac
County.</p>

<p>It is important to note here that the
Illinois of Clark&rsquo;s day&mdash;as is partly true
now&mdash;was composed of three kinds of land:
swampy or &ldquo;drowned&rdquo; lands, prairie land,
and timber land. Being practically a level
country, the forests became as prominent
landmarks as mountains and hills are in
rugged districts. Routes of travel clung<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
to the prairies; and camping-places, if
water could be had in the neighborhood,
were always chosen on the edge of a forest
where wood could be obtained. Between
wood and water, of course the latter was the
greater necessity. The prairie district in
Illinois does not extend below Williamson
County, and famous Phelps Prairie in that
county is the most southern in the state.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Both routes from Fort Massac made straight,
therefore, for Phelps Prairie, in which the
town of Bainbridge, Williamson County,
now stands. Here the two routes joined
again; or, rather, the Buffalo Gap route
met, in Phelps Prairie, the Kaskaskia
Trace, as the &ldquo;Old Massac Road&rdquo; had met
it in Pope County. The former point of
intersection was on the &ldquo;Brooks place,&rdquo;
section 9, township 9, range 2E, Williamson
County.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The Buffalo Gap route was
known as the &ldquo;middle trail;&rdquo; the third
route northwest from Fort Massac pursued
this path to a point on the Cache above
Indian Point; thence it swung westward,
keeping far south of the prairie land,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
passed near Carbondale, Williamson County,
and crossed the Big Muddy River at
Murphysboro.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It was known as the
&ldquo;western trail.&rdquo; Not touching the prairie
land, it is plain that the route could be used
only in the driest of midsummer weather.</p>

<p>The evidence that Clark&rsquo;s guides took
the middle trail is overwhelming; the western
trail was too wet and did not touch any
prairie&mdash;this utterly excludes that route
from the list of possibilities. According to
Clark&rsquo;s <i>Memoir</i>, on the third day out the
party reached a prairie where the chief guide
became confused; Clark&rsquo;s command to him
was to discover and take them into the
hunter&rsquo;s road that led from the east into
Kaskaskia. There can be no doubt that this
&ldquo;hunter&rsquo;s road&rdquo; which came from the
east was the Kaskaskia-Shawneetown trace,
which the Old Massac Road joined in Pope
County, or that the middle trail was the
one which the party had been following;
the junction of the middle trail on the
Brooks Place, above mentioned, is in
Phelps Prairie and about a three days&rsquo;
march from Fort Massac. The junction of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the trail passing from Fort Massac eastward
of the Massac County lakes with the Kaskaskia
and Shawneetown trace is not more
than a day&rsquo;s march from Fort Massac and
is not in a prairie. There can be no doubt,
therefore, that Clark&rsquo;s brave band stole
northward on the middle trace, the Buffalo
Gap route. Clark would not have commanded
his guide, under pain of death, to
find the Kaskaskia Trace if the party had
been traversing that trace and had merely
missed the way. Every implication is that
the Kaskaskia Trace was the goal sought
and not yet found.</p>

<p>The first day&rsquo;s march of about eighteen
miles was a hard one, passing over the
winding trail which skirted the southern
side of the marshes that flanked the sloughs
and lakes of Massac County, but finally
leading to the bluffs, near the Cache River,
where, probably on Indian Point, the first
night&rsquo;s camp was pitched.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The first taste of the swamps of Illinois
was not discouraging, and on the day after,
June 29, the march was resumed. The
route today was on the top of the water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>shed
between the Cache River on the left
(west) and Dutchman&rsquo;s Creek on the right.
Buffalo Gap was passed today, a mile south
of the present Goreville, Johnson County.
Camp was pitched this night, after a
twenty-mile march, probably at the spring
two miles north of the present Pulley&rsquo;s
Mill. The route all day was along the
buffalo trail or hunter&rsquo;s road from which
Buffalo Gap received its name.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This gap,
like Moccasin Gap to the eastward, was a
famous portal to the prairie country for the
bison, Indian, and white man. Two old-time
state roads were built through these
two gaps.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Pushing forward from the spring near
Pulley&rsquo;s Mill on the morning of June 30,
the Virginians ere long came into the prairie
lands lying in Williamson County. Phelps
Prairie was reached first, the path entering
the southern portion of the prairie. Here
it was that &ldquo;John Saunders, our principal
guide, appeared confused, and we soon discovered
that he was totally lost.&rdquo; These Illinois
prairies are almost treeless, save near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the water courses; the grass in the old days
grew rank and high and one could tell his
course only, perhaps, by the stars, if the
pathways were obscured. The paths in
these prairies are overgrown in the summer
time,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and it is probable that this is why
Clark&rsquo;s guide, attempting to find the Kaskaskia
Trace, lost his bearings. The
important landmarks in these prairies were
the forests which often bounded them and
in many instances extended into them.
These extremities of the forests were and
are still known as &ldquo;points,&rdquo; and many of
them are yet landmarks in Illinois history.
A spring beside a point in a prairie made
an ideal camping-spot known to half a
continent in the olden time. Clark&rsquo;s campground
in Phelps Prairie was, without
doubt, at a spring just west of Bainbridge.</p>

<p>Northward from Phelps Prairie two routes
ran to Kaskaskia: a wet and a dry route.
The one which we may call the highland
route led north through Herrin&rsquo;s Prairie
and swung around to the Mississippi by
heading such streams as Pipestone, Rattlesnake,
and Galium, crossing the Big Muddy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
River at Humphry&rsquo;s Ford, section 30, township
8, range 2E.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This was the dry
route, the preferable one the year round.
Another shorter course ran northwest and
crossed many of the streams which the
highland route headed. There can be little
doubt that Clark&rsquo;s guides chose this latter
course. By Clark&rsquo;s <i>Memoir</i> we know it to
have been a dry season, and the shortest,
and probably the least traveled, course
would best suit his plan of surprising Kaskaskia.
The shortness of the time (four
days) in which the distance to Kaskaskia
was covered from Phelps Prairie almost
precludes the possibility of his having used
the longer watershed route.</p>

<p>On the first day of July, then, the little
army moved from near the present Bainbridge
along a well-known trail which
crossed Crab Orchard Creek at Greathouse
Crossing<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> (section 2, township 9, range
1W)<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and the Big Muddy at Marshall&rsquo;s
Shoals, section 6, township 9, range 1W,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
southwest of De Soto, Jackson County.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It
is possible that camp, on the night of July 1,
was pitched at Greathouse Crossing; if so
the day&rsquo;s march was not a long one. From
the Big Muddy the trail struck to the
watershed between the Beaucoup and its
tributaries on the north and the tributaries
of the Big Muddy on the south, running
near the present Lenan in Jackson County.
The course now was a watershed route from
the Big Muddy to the St. Mary River, and
is marked today by the significant names
of such high altitude towns as Shiloh Hill,
Teacup Knob, and Wine Hill. Through
these places an ancient highway has coursed
from times to which the memory of white
men runneth not to the contrary. Water
was scarce on the highest grounds, but
springs, here and there, were well known,
and at one of these, probably near Lenan
(section 15, township 8, range 3), the adventurers
paused, on the night of September 2,
and built their evening fires.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>The end was now almost in sight; two
days more and the immediate basin of the
Mississippi River would be reached, and
the success or failure of the daring raid be
decided. It can be easily imagined that it
was a silent and eager body of men which,
on September 3, strode forward over the
rolling hills of Randolph County on the old
trail. Their excitement must have been
intense. The old trail from Lenan entered
Randolph County near the center of section
12, township 7, south of range 5 W and
passed over Teacup Knob in section 5 and
near the present Wine Hill P. O. Pushing
on over the hills, the St. Mary River was
reached at the site of what became the &ldquo;Old
State Ford,&rdquo; near Welge Station (formerly
Bremen Station) on the Wabash, Chester
and Western Railroad&mdash;section 1, township
7 S., range 6 W.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Here the last camp of
the march was pitched on the night of July
3&mdash;the &ldquo;glorious Fourth&rdquo; was to see the
little invading army lying quietly on the
outskirts of quaint old Kaskaskia.</p>

<p>From the state ford on the St. Mary, the
course was the highland route running near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Diamond Cross.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Here, on the watershed
between the tributaries of the St. Mary and
the Kaskaskia, lay the worn Vincennes
Trace running northeast from Kaskaskia to
the Wabash. It is probable that Clark
entered this highway before the Kaskaskia
River was reached.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> And at the end of
the journey awaited victory; Governor
Rochblave was completely surprised, and
Kaskaskia was captured by the perilous
feat of actually marching up to it and taking
possession of it with the assumed
arrogance of a powerful conqueror.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>From the moment Kaskaskia was in
Clark&rsquo;s hands he turned his attention to
Vincennes, and in July, through the co&ouml;peration
of the French priest Gibault, the
inhabitants were induced to proclaim themselves
American subjects and to hoist an
American flag. Captain Helm of Clark&rsquo;s
little army was posted at Vincennes with a
guard, and Helm it was who was captured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
in the fall by the British Lieutenant-governor
Hamilton of Detroit. The latter had
pushed his difficult way up the Maumee and
down the Wabash to seize the revolted
town.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Throughout the winter Clark
feared a swift advance from Vincennes;
and, to save himself from being captured
by Hamilton, Clark desperately resolved to
capture him. By February 5 a new &ldquo;grand
army,&rdquo; of four companies, possibly one
hundred and sixty strong, well-armed, but
without tents and horse, save a few packhorses,
departed from Kaskaskia on the
desperate journey across the swimming
prairies and flooded rivers of Illinois for
Vincennes.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Had one man dropped from
the ranks each mile, not one of the one
hundred and sixty would have reached the
Wabash. Few expeditions in American
history have been recounted more than
this; it is strange that the route of this
immortal little army has never been care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>fully
considered&mdash;for the story of the route
is almost the whole story of the campaign.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>From the original in the British Museum</i>]</p>
</div>


<p>Crossing the Kaskaskia River February
5, 1779, Clark&rsquo;s army lay three miles from
Kaskaskia, for two days, &ldquo;to tighten
belts.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It is impossible to determine
how much was known of their path onward.
To many it had been well known for nearly
a century&mdash;an old watershed prairie route
marked out by the buffalo and followed by
missionaries&mdash;the Appian Way of Illinois.
The difficulty in studying this route, it
should be stated at once, arises from the
fact that while Kaskaskia was formerly the
metropolis of western Illinois, the rise of
St. Louis across the Mississippi had the
effect of altering previously traveled routes.
What has been ever known as the St. Louis
Trace, coursing across Illinois from Vincennes
to the Mississippi, became in the
nineteenth century what the old Kaskaskia
Trace had been in the eighteenth century,
just as what had been the &ldquo;Old Massac
Road&rdquo; became known as the St. Louis-Shawneetown Road. As
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
a result, the later
Kaskaskia travelers followed the St. Louis
Trace&mdash;much-traveled, broad, and hard&mdash;as
far westward as Marion County, and
then turned due southwest to Kaskaskia.
Therefore it is necessary not to confound
the ancient Kaskaskia trace to Vincennes
with the later Kaskaskia trace which was
identical for some distance with the more
northerly St. Louis Trace.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> At the same
time it is easy to err in separating the older
and newer routes too widely in the attempt
not to confound them. The newer St.
Louis Trace runs across from Indiana (Vincennes)
to Missouri (St. Louis) through the
Illinois counties of Lawrence, Richland,
Clay, Marion, Clinton, and St. Clair. The
course is practically that of the old Mississippi
and Ohio (now the Baltimore and Ohio
Southwestern) Railway. The route passed
over the best course between the points, as
proved by the railway surveyors and en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>gineers.
But many rivers blocked the
way; the first of these from Vincennes was
the Embarras&mdash;so called, as in the case of
many streams, because the great floods left
deposits of driftwood which seriously impeded
navigation. West of the Embarras
came the petulant Little Wabash and the
Big Muddy, draining thousands of square
miles of swamp and prairie, and, in rainy
seasons, uniting and spreading out five
miles in width. West of the tributaries of
the Little Wabash come those of the Kaskaskia.
A few smaller Wabash and Mississippi
tributaries, such as the Bonpas and St.
Mary are headed by this trans-Illinois route,
but it was not, in one sense, a watershed
route, crossing the Embarras, Little Wabash,
Fox, Beaucoup, and Kaskaskia and
their tributaries.</p>

<p>These streams flow southward. Kaskaskia
lay some fifty miles south of St. Louis
and the later St. Louis Trace. The route
of the more ancient Kaskaskia Trace to
Vincennes, therefore, ran some seventy-five
miles in a northeast direction; then, turning
due east, it ran about one hundred miles
to the Wabash. For the first seventy-five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
miles it was a watershed route, coursing
along the highland prairies between Three
Mile, Plum, Crooked, Grand Point, and
Raccoon Creeks&mdash;all tributaries of the Kaskaskia
River&mdash;on the west and north, and
the heads of the St. Mary, Beaucoup, and
Big Muddy Rivers on the east and south.
This backbone line of prairie land runs
straight northeast through Randolph and
Washington Counties, cutting into corners
of Perry, Jefferson, and Marion Counties.
But here in Marion County the backbone,
which had been accommodatingly trending
eastward, turned quickly to the north to
avoid the treacherous Little Wabash; at
this point the old trace divided into two
courses both of which ran to Vincennes.
One course, probably that known later as
the eastern half of the St. Louis Trace,
passed through the center of Clay, Richland,
and Lawrence Counties, crossing both
the Little Wabash and Big Muddy a short
distance above their junction, the Embarras
near Lawrence, and the Wabash at Vincennes.
The other branch of the Kaskaskia
Trace passed through the northern portion
of Wayne, Edwards and Wabash Counties,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
crossing the Little Wabash and Fox some
two miles above their junction, the Bonpas
River, near Bonpas, and the Wabash, two
miles above St. Francisville. From this
ford the route led up the eastern shore of
the Wabash about nine miles to Vincennes.
By any route, at any time of year, the journey
across Illinois was a hardship no thinking
man would undergo, save only on the
most important mission; in the winter
season&mdash;with the Wabash a surging sea,
the Little Wabash a running lake, Crooked
Creek treacherously straight, water frozen
on the prairies, the &ldquo;points&rdquo; of timber
swampy morasses&mdash;all communication
landward was cut off, with the beavers and
blue racers swimming for the high ground.</p>

<p>In their right mind, Clark&rsquo;s adventurers
would probably not have faced the wilderness
into which they strode on the morning
of February 7 on any private affair of life
or death. Two magnetic influences drew
them on; these Americans had brought to
Illinois the spirit of 1775, a breath of a
boasted freedom that was half license, in
which the hot-headed French exulted.
Believing the Americophobite British, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
inhabitants of Kaskaskia had feared the
barbarian Virginians more than any savages;
Clark made capital of this in securing
Kaskaskia, and later, by the kindness with
which he treated the inhabitants and the
freedom he gave them, accomplished a
moral victory as sweeping and as picturesque
as his military achievement. The
proposed plan to carry to reconquered Vincennes
the blessings of liberty enjoyed at
Kaskaskia under Virginian rule appealed
strongly to the impressionable <i>habitants</i>;
to Clark&rsquo;s own patriot soldiers the Vincennes
campaign was the very acme of
frontier adventure. Again, the young,
daring Clark&mdash;quiet, resourceful, irrepressible&mdash;was
a potent factor in pushing these
men out on a journey of such unparalleled
hardship. True, it is difficult to look
beyond the later George Rogers Clark, of
soiled reputation, to the cool, brave youth
of twenty-seven years who led these men
through the prairies of Illinois in 1779. To
dim the brilliant lustre of such days as
these was a heavy&mdash;if not the heaviest&mdash;price
to pay for indiscretions of later years.
Yet, as the records of this handful of men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
are studied, and especially when the track
of their memorable march is picked out and
followed, one can fancy the clear, bright
picture of the Clark of 1779 and, happily,
believe for the moment that there is no
connection between him and the later Clark
whom the Spaniards knew. It is plain that
the French were charmed by the dashing
Virginian and his Vincennes chimera. The
record Clark left of the expedition&mdash;written
ere the grasshopper was a burden or those
were darkened who stood at the windows&mdash;clearly
implies that the expedition
was launched with a levity that it is sure
all did not feel, though it may have been
perfectly assumed; and as the days passed
we shall see that Clark hurried on in order
to get his men too far to turn back. His
diplomatic endeavors, throughout those
marvelous fifteen days, to lure his men on,
to lift their thoughts from their sufferings
and incite them to their almost superhuman
tasks, are perhaps without parallel in the
history of marching armies in America.</p>

<p>Departing from the two days&rsquo; camping-place,
three miles from Kaskaskia, the course,
for almost the entire first day, lay through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
thick forests, which have quite disappeared
since that time, on the watershed between
the Kaskaskia tributaries on the northwest
and those of the St. Mary on the southeast.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Fortunately the journey at the outset was
comparatively easy; the weather was warm
for the season, though rainy. A good
march was made on the seventh through
the forests and out into Lively Prairie, half
a mile northeast of Salem, Randolph County,
where the course of the old trail is well
known. Beyond this, Flat Prairie opened
the way toward the &ldquo;Great Rib,&rdquo; as the
French knew the ridge in Grand Cote Prairie
(<i>La Prairie de la Grande C&ocirc;te</i>) on which
the present village of Coultersville, Randolph
County, stands. The first night&rsquo;s
camp was pitched probably in Flat Prairie,
between Salem and Coultersville.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
authoritative record for this day&rsquo;s march,
as of all others, is the official Bowman&rsquo;s
<i>Journal</i>:<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> &ldquo;Made a good march for about
nine hours; the road very bad, with mud
and water. Pitched our camp in a square,
baggage in the middle, every company to
guard their own squares.&rdquo; On the eighth
the record continues: &ldquo;Marched early
through the waters, which we now began
to meet in those large and level plains,
where, from the flatness of the country,
[water] rests a considerable time before
it drains off; notwithstanding which, our
men were in great spirits, though much
fatigued.&rdquo; By the eighth it would seem
the little band had reached the lower plains
in the northwest corner of Perry County,
two and a half miles northwest of Swanwick,
where the headwaters of the Big
Muddy tributary of the Kaskaskia were
crossed, and the prairie south of Oakdale,
Washington County, at which point Elkhorn
Creek was crossed at the famous
&ldquo;Meadow-in-the-Hole&rdquo; of old French days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
This region was also known as <i>Corne de Cerf</i>,
Elkhorn Prairie, Elkhorn Point and Ayres
Point.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Prairie, forest, and bottom land
were not far apart here. The &ldquo;Meadow-in-the-Hole&rdquo;
was a singular little meadow,
fifty or sixty yards wide, located on a &ldquo;dry
branch&rdquo; of the Elkhorn and thirty feet
lower than the surrounding forests&mdash;at
what is now Oakdale on the Elkhorn.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
From the present Oakdale the pathway ran
from Elkhorn Prairie through Nashville
Prairie, circling half a mile to the north
and northeast of Nashville, Washington
County. Turning to the east here, it
coursed onward to a celebrated &ldquo;point&rdquo; of
woods called Grand Point, near the present
Grand Point Creek, section 32, township 2,
south range 1W, two miles and a half northwest
of Richview, Washington County.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
From thence it circled northeast through
section 9 in Grand Prairie Township, the
extreme northwest township of Jefferson
County.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The second night&rsquo;s camp may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
have been pitched on Grand Point Creek,
near Richview; and that of the ninth on
Raccoon Creek, near Walnut Point, one
mile north of Walnut Hill, Marion County.
The old trail from Grand Prairie, Jefferson
County, entered Marion County at section
32, Centralia Township, on the old Israel
Jennings farm. Walnut Hill was two miles
north of due east from the Jennings farm,
through which, it may be added in passing,
ran the later famous St. Louis-Shawneetown
road.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Bowman&rsquo;s record for the ninth
and tenth reads: &ldquo;9th. Made another day&rsquo;s
march. Fair part of the day. 10th.
Crossed the river of the Petit Fork upon
trees that were felled for that purpose, the
water being so high there was no fording
it. Still raining and no tents. Encamped
near the river. Stormy weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here we have the first definite mention
of a camping-place; the Petit Fork was the
Adams or Horse tributary of Skillet
Creek&mdash;the first tributary of the Little
Wabash and Big Wabash the army encountered.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
The crossing-place was near Far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>rington,
Jefferson County<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>&mdash;fifteen short
miles from Walnut Point and known in
early days as Yellow Bark.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The feat of
felling trees across this rushing stream
being accomplished, the men crawled over
and encamped on the eastern bank. A
picture of the army splashing along through
the watery prairies would be greatly prized
today, but a picture of it creeping across
Petit Fork on felled tree-trunks would be
of extraordinary interest; it is one of the
remarkable incidents of the heroic adventure.</p>

<p>Of these days the accounts of Clark
furnish us almost no information.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The
incident of the Petit Fork was not sufficiently
notable to receive mention, for Clark
wrote Mason: &ldquo;The first obstruction of any
consequence that I met with was on the
13th [the Little Wabash];&rdquo; yet in his
<i>Memoir</i>&mdash;written, it must be remembered,
as late as 1791&mdash;he describes the march to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the Little Wabash as made &ldquo;through
incredible difficulties, far surpassing anything
that any of us had ever experienced.&rdquo;
The <i>Letter</i> breathes the spirit of the youth,
for it was written in 1779; the <i>Memoir</i> ever
reads like an old man&rsquo;s reminiscences.
Clark&rsquo;s diplomacy in securing the loyalty
of his men through great discouragements
indicates a high order of the best qualities
of a military commander. &ldquo;My object
now,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;was to keep the men in
spirits.&rdquo; He allowed the men to kill game
and hold typical Indian feasts after the hard
day&rsquo;s wet march. Before their rousing
fires, with venison and bear meat savoring
the air, little wonder the night brought
partial forgetfulness of the day&rsquo;s fatigue.
The four companies took turns at being
hosts; the company on duty each day being
supplied with horses on which to transport
the game brought down. And throughout
every day&rsquo;s march Clark, and his equally
courageous officers, made light of all difficulties,
and &ldquo;putting on the woodsman,
shouting now and then and Running as
much through the mud and water as any of
them. Thus, Insensibly, without a mur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>mur,
was those men led on to the Banks of
the Little Wabash which we reached on
the 13th.&rdquo; The spectacle, here presented,
of officers inveigling soldiers forward, is
one of the most singular in the history of
the West. We may well believe Clark
refers particularly to the two French companies
which composed a most important
arm of his force&mdash;the Virginians, perhaps,
not needing equal inspiration to endeavor.
The climax in Clark&rsquo;s diplomacy was
reached as he now approached the flood-tides
of the raging Little Wabash.</p>

<p>It is necessary here to emphasize that the
army, turning eastward just north of present
Nashville, abandoned the watershed to
which their path had thus far held; the
route now was nearly due east, across the
tributaries of the Little Wabash. Of these,
Petit Fork (Adams tributary of the Skillet)
was the first to be encountered; it was
passed with great heroism on the tenth of
February. On the eleventh the eastward
route was followed and the Saline River
(Skillet Creek) was crossed. Bowman&rsquo;s
record reads: &ldquo;11th. Crossed the Saline
river. Nothing extraordinary this day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>&rdquo;
The route between the Skillet and Little
Wabash may have been either one of the
two courses mentioned, not over five miles
apart, and running parallel to each other.
The northern passed through the southern
portion of Clay County, the southern
through the northern portion of Wayne.
There were two encampments between the
Petit Fork and the Little Wabash; if the
northern route was pursued, these camps
were near Xenia and Clay City in Wayne
County; if the southern route was followed,
the camps were near Blue Point and Mount
Erie in Wayne County. Bowman&rsquo;s record
for the twelfth is: &ldquo;12th. Marched across
Cot plains;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> saw and killed numbers of
buffaloes. The road very bad from the
immense quantity of rain that had fallen.
The men much fatigued. Encamped on
the edge of the woods. This plain or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
meadow being fifteen or more miles across,
it was late in the night before the baggage
and troops got together. Now twenty-
[forty-] one miles from St. Vincent. 13th.
Arrived early at the two Wabashes.
Although a league asunder, they now made
but one. We set to making a canoe.&rdquo;
Clark&rsquo;s records of the arrival at the Little
Wabash read (from his <i>Memoir</i>): &ldquo;This
place is called the two Little Wabashes;
they are three miles apart and from the
Heights of the one to that of the other on
the opposite shores is five miles the whole
under water gen<sup>ly</sup> about three feet Deep
never under two and frequently four;&rdquo;
(from <i>Letter to Mason</i>) &ldquo;Arriving at the two
Little Wabashes, although three miles
asunder&mdash;they now make but one&mdash;the
flowed water between them being at least
three feet deep and in many places four.
Being near five miles to the opposite hills,
the shallowest place, except about one hundred
yards, was three feet.&rdquo; So far as
these records go, either the Clay or the
Wayne County route might have been that
pursued. The long prairie of which Bowman
speaks would have been, on the Clay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
County route, &ldquo;Twelve Mile Prairie&rdquo; situated
between the present towns on the
Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Railway,
Xenia and Clay City; on the Wayne County
route it would have been &ldquo;Long Prairie&rdquo;
lying between Blue Point and Mount Erie.
The &ldquo;two Wabashes&rdquo; on the Clay County
route would have been the Little Wabash
River and the Big Muddy Creek. By the
Wayne County route the two Wabashes
would have been the Little Wabash and
Fox River.</p>

<p>The indefatigable Lyman C. Draper,
after a large correspondence with many of
the best informed men in Illinois on the
subject of the crossing-place of the Little
Wabash, came to the firm conclusion that
the two Wabashes were the Little Wabash
and the Fox; the present writer after
studying that correspondence and visiting
the ground in question&mdash;which Mr. Draper
did not find time to do&mdash;quite as firmly
believes that the crossing-place was above
the junction of the Little Wabash and Big
Muddy Creek at the old McCauley&rsquo;s settlement&mdash;in
the southeast corner of section
21 of Clay County, range 8E, two miles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
east of old Maysville, which was three-fourths
of a mile south of the present Clay
City station on the Baltimore and Ohio
Southwestern Railway. By this upper
route Clark would have been on higher
ground before and after crossing the Little
Wabash. It is quite sure his party passed
a salt spring (see p. 66) and the only one
in this region was on this upper route.
And finally, Bowman states that on the
day after crossing the Little Wabash the
party crossed the Fox River. This could
not have been possible if the Little Wabash
and Fox were crossed simultaneously. But
even a slight discussion of the question may
well be relegated to an appendix.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> At
either crossing-place, and the two are but a
few miles apart, a most desperate situation
confronted the intrepid Clark and his tired
band of invaders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;... I Viewed this Sheet of water for
some time with Distrust,&rdquo; Clark wrote in
his <i>Memoir</i>, &ldquo;but accusing myself of Doubting
I amediately Set to work without holding
any consultation about it or suffering
anybody else to do so in my presence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
ordered a perogue amediately built and
acted as though crossing the water would
be only a piece of diversion.... My
aneziety [anxiety] to cross this place continually
increased as I saw that it would at
once fling us into a situation of folorn hope
as all Ideas of a Retreat would in some
Measure be done away that if the Men
began after this was accomplished to think
seriously of what they had really suffered
that they prefer<sup>d</sup> Risking any seeming
difficulty that might probably turn out
favourable than to attempt to Retreat when
they would be certain of Experiencing
what they had already felt and if the
weather should but Freeze altogether impracticable,
except the Ice would bear
them.&rdquo; The heroism of Clark&rsquo;s crossing
of the Little Wabash has been retold on a
thousand pages but it has rarely been suggested
that he hurried into these dangers
eagerly because they would serve to thwart
any hope of retreat. He not only &ldquo;burned
his bridges,&rdquo; but hastened impetuously
across waters that could never be bridged,
in the hope that they would freeze and cut
off all dreams of retreat. This memoir, let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
it again be remarked, was written many
years after the event&mdash;after Clark saw
his great feat somewhat in the light we see
it today. His letter to Mason, however,
was written in the same year that the march
was made; if not so self-laudatory, it is as
interesting as the memoir, and perhaps
more authentic. He thus described the
crossing in that document: &ldquo;This [flood]
would have been enough to have stopped
any set of men not in the same temper that
we were. But in three days we contrived
to cross by building a large canoe, ferried
across the two channels; the rest of the
way we waded, building scaffolds at each
to lodge our baggage on until the horses
crossed to take them.&rdquo; Bowman&rsquo;s record
is that of the soldier: &ldquo;14th. Finished the
canoe and put her into the river about 4
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. 15th. Ferried
across the two Wabashes, it being then five
miles in water to the opposite hills, where
we encamped. Still raining. Orders not
to fire any guns for the future, but in case
of necessity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When, near Olney, Clark&rsquo;s men crossed
the Fox River on the 16th of February, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
is probable that they camped on what is
now the St. Louis Trace Road on one of
the northeastern tributaries of the Fox.
The day after, an early start was made in
order that the famed Embarras might be
reached before nightfall. It can well be
believed that an intense, hushed excitement
prevailed. The success of the invasion
must depend on a swift surprise; it was
probable that all would be lost if the
approach was discovered; for, the Wabash
being out of banks, the enemy, doubtless
well supplied with boats, would have
Clark&rsquo;s band at their mercy. The provisions
were fast giving out; surrender or
starvation stared Clark in the face if discovered.
Accordingly, Commissary Kennedy
with three guides was sent forward &ldquo;to
cross the river Embarrass,&rdquo; Clark wrote in
his <i>Memoir</i>, &ldquo;... and, if possible, to
get some vessels in the vicinity of the town
[Vincennes], but principally if he could get
some information.&rdquo; &ldquo;About an hour, by
sun, we got near the river Embarras,&rdquo; Bowman
wrote in his <i>Journal</i>; &ldquo;Found the
country all overflowed with water.&rdquo; The
Embarras was reached near Lawrenceville<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and the river was descended a few miles&mdash;&ldquo;Traveled
till 8 o&rsquo;clock in mud and water,&rdquo;
wrote Bowman&mdash;before a camping-spot
was found.</p>

<p>On the morning of the eighteenth the
morning gun at Fort Sackville (Vincennes)
was heard. The Wabash was reached at
two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, but no
boats could be found by the parties of
searchers sent out on rafts and in a canoe.
Affairs were growing desperate, and the
&ldquo;very quiet but hungry&rdquo; men set to work
building canoes. Messengers were sent to
hurry on &ldquo;The Willing&rdquo; but did not find
her. &ldquo;No provisions of any sort,&rdquo; writes
Bowman on the nineteenth, &ldquo;now for two
days. Hard fortune!&rdquo; On the twentieth,
as work on the canoes advanced, a canoe
containing five Frenchmen from Vincennes
was captured, and Clark learned that he
was not yet discovered. On the twenty-first
the army began to be ferried across
the Wabash, &ldquo;to a small hill called [Mammelle ?].&rdquo;
The crossing-place cannot be
determined with precision. It was below
the mouth of the Embarras, and not lower
on the Wabash than a mile and a half above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
St. Francisville. Several <i>mammelles</i> (bluffs)
lie on the eastern bank of the Wabash here.
One lies four and one-half miles below the
mouth of the Embarras. As the current
was swift, the river broad, and the point of
embarkation somewhat below the mouth of
the Embarras, it is probable that the army
landed further down the Wabash than has
usually been described.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> A march of three
miles northward was made by the vanguard
on the day it crossed, seemingly from the
&ldquo;lower&rdquo; to the &ldquo;upper&rdquo; <i>mammelle</i>&mdash;the
&ldquo;next hill of the same name,&rdquo; according
to Bowman. On the twenty-second another
league was covered by exhausting efforts,
making in all six miles from the crossing-place.
The camp this night is definitely
known to be a high, twenty-acre sugar
orchard still remembered as &ldquo;Sugar Camp,&rdquo;
three and one-half miles from Vincennes.
Clark was now at the lower end of the
&ldquo;Lower Prairie,&rdquo; and there were two
courses to Vincennes which lay on the
rising ground across the three miles of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
flooded prairie.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> One, by way of the
Grand Marais or swamp in the middle of
the prairie, was impassable; the other
route, known as the &ldquo;two buttes route,&rdquo;
was the difficult alternative. The first
butte was &ldquo;Warrior&rsquo;s Island,&rdquo; a ten-acre hill
heavily wooded, a mile and a half from
Sugar Camp and two miles from Vincennes.
It could be and was reached by the strong
men wading breast high, drawing or paddling
their feebler comrades in the canoes.
The second butte, &ldquo;Bunker Hill,&rdquo; was not
on the direct line to Vincennes, but was a
high point to the east on the same plateau
on which Vincennes stood. At one o&rsquo;clock
of the twenty-third, the floundering army,
half numb with cold and weak from exposure,
reached Warrior&rsquo;s Island. From here
Clark sent his first message, diplomatically
directed to the inhabitants of Vincennes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>&mdash;Being now within two
miles of your village with my army, determined
to take your fort this night, and not
being willing to surprise you, I take this
method to request such of you as are true
citizens, and willing to enjoy the liberty I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
bring you, to remain still in your houses,
and those, if any there be, who are friends
to the king, will instantly repair to the fort<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
and join the <i>Hair-buyer General</i>,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and fight
like men. And if any such as do not go to
the fort shall be discovered afterwards, they
may depend on severe punishment. On
the contrary, those who are true friends to
liberty may depend on being well treated;
and I once more request them to keep out
of the streets, for every one I find in arms
on my arrival I shall treat as an enemy.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock that night the famished
army waded to Bunker Hill, and soon the
outskirts of the town were invested, under
fire of the fort. On the twenty-fourth
Hamilton surrendered, and the campaign,
prosecuted under difficulties which today
cannot be justly described, ended in complete
triumph.</p>

<span class="caption smcap">The St. Louis Trace, near Lawrenceville, Illinois</span>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nothing can impress one with the heroism
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
of this march like a visit to these
low lands which are now proving of
great value to horse and cattle owners of
northern Illinois as grazing grounds.
Though my journey over Clark&rsquo;s route was
made at the driest and most favorable season
of the year, the mists, heavy as clouds, lay
along the Bonpas, Fox, Little Wabash, Big
Muddy, and Skillet and between them, and
a thunderstorm made the modern road a
veritable slough. From Vincennes to
Xenia, the Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern
Railway is parallel with the old
St. Louis Trace which was Clark&rsquo;s route
here.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> But the student will find the journey
by the old trace, throwing its curling
lengths along the hills from Lawrenceville
to Sumner, a most interesting though
taxing experience. At Sumner the trace
drops into the bottom-lands where the mists
seem to lie forever and where little villages
are perched upon knolls of a few thousand
feet in diameter, surrounded by swamps
and prairies that are now being drained and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
cultivated widely. Here the old trace&mdash;for
the ancient name clings to it&mdash;is helped
along by dint of corduroy bridges and stone
and wooden culverts. Between Sumner
and Olney the corduroy bridges are frequent
and exceedingly rough, particularly
if you are hurrying along at nightfall to
gain the portals of a comparatively comfortable
inn at Olney. Westward the road
ploughs its way through the marshes and
the mist to the little Big Muddy and across
to the Little Wabash about where the old
trace ran. Here the fogs lie heaviest,
shutting off all view of the low-lying, bushy
wastes. In midsummer the fog and marshes
warn the explorer away; what of this land
when the rivers are loosed by the winter
floods and are streaming wildly along the
vast stretch of the stunted bush and vine?
The scene presented to Clark&rsquo;s Virginians
and Frenchmen in February 1779 cannot by
any means be pictured by one to whom
these swamps are unknown; to such as
know them, the picture, though probably
imperfect, is one of horror. To row a boat
where the current is swift is fatiguing labor,
and to walk in the water, when each step<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
may find one in a sink-hole and where the
rank grasses, growing from heavy tufts,
hold one&rsquo;s feet as a cord, is all that the
strongest man can endure for even a short
period. The little spots of ground which
here and there rise above the flood are
covered with driftwood and infested with
snakes.</p>

<p>In midsummer the scene was more
pleasant. &ldquo;Beyond Ombra we enter a
Tartarian meadow,&rdquo; wrote Volney in 1804,
&ldquo;interspersed with clumps of trees, but in
general flat and naked, and windy and cold
in winter. In summer it is filled with tall
and strong shrubs, which brush the legs of
the rider in his narrow path so much, that
a journey out [to Kaskaskia] and back will
wear out a pair of boots. Water is scarce
[for drinking], and there is danger of being
bewildered, as happened to one of my fellow
travellers, three years before, when,
with two others, he roamed about for seventeen
days. Thunder, rain, gnats, and
horse flies, are very troublesome in summer.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The junction of the old Kaskaskia Trace
with the modern St. Louis Trace was on
the Isaac Elliott farm, one mile east of old
Xenia, half a mile north of the newer
Xenia.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> It was pointed out to the writer
by Sandy Alexander Nelms of Salem, Illinois,
one of the very few remaining old-time
stage-drivers on the St. Louis Trace
of the thirties, who was born near this
junction. He remembers portions of the
old path very well, though it has not, within
his lifetime, been used as a highway.
Within the borders of the present Xenia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the outline of the old trace is exceedingly
plain. The frontispiece of this volume is
from a recent photograph of this part of
the road. Mr. Nelms informs the writer
that the old trace could, in early years, be
followed by the camping-spots, where blue-grass
sprang up when the prairie-grass was
killed out.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Blue-grass on the Illinois
routes, like the apple-trees on the old track
from Albany to the Mohawk in New York,
was the first sign of coming civilization.
Mr. Nelms remembers with distinctness
that in a corn-field near the present Baltimore
and Ohio Southwestern Railway
depot at Xenia the route of the old trace
could be followed by the color of the earth
and heavier growth of corn. The general
color of the field was black but a wide strip
of yellowish clay was the course of the old
Kaskaskia Trace&mdash;generations of travel
over the narrow aisle in the old-time forests
having changed the nature of the soil.
Here, it is said, the crop of corn was distinctly
heavier and better than elsewhere
on the prairie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Wherever this old trace may be found
it speaks of Clark and Clark only. All the
story of its other days is forgotten for
those hard fifteen during which that daring
youth drew his comrades &ldquo;insensibly&rdquo;
onward, amid jests and raillery, to the
British stronghold from which thousands
of savages had been urged to war upon the
feeble Kentucky stations. Boone&rsquo;s Wilderness
Road meant much, but if Fort Sackville
and the other Wabash Valley centers
had been a trifle more potent than they
were, it would have become as overgrown
as was Braddock&rsquo;s Road when Forbes
marched to Fort Duquesne three years
after Braddock. The two posts at the
termini of the Vincennes Trace, and the
dark councils of their commanders, were a
more serious menace to Kentucky&rsquo;s safety
than all the redskins north of the Ohio
River. It was the British-fed, British-armed,
and British-led Indians that made
possible the dream of a reconquest of Kentucky.</p>

<p>After George Rogers Clark led his men
over that narrow, winding trace, through
flooded Grand Cote Prairie and over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
raging Little and Great Wabash, that danger
of British conquest of Kentucky was
practically eliminated from the western
situation.</p>

<p>The capture of Vincennes was the first
chapter in the conquest of the Old Northwest.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>MIAMI VALLEY CAMPAIGNS</h3>


<p>The various campaigns directed from
Kentucky and western Pennsylvania
had, by 1779, comparatively freed
what is now eastern and central Ohio of
red-men. Little by little they had been
pushed in a northwesterly direction until
the headwaters of the Great and Little
Miami and Scioto were reached. Here on
the backbone of Ohio, near the headwaters
of the St. Mary and Auglaize Rivers&mdash;a
pleasant country which the Indians always
loved&mdash;the most heroic stand was yet to
be made against the encroaching white men.</p>

<p>The point of vantage was well chosen, as
the bloody years of 1780-1795 proved.
The forests were divided by large stretches
of open land, which were easily cultivated
and exceedingly rich. To the northward
flowed the Auglaize River affording a highway
to the great Maumee Valley and Lake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Erie. The St. Mary offered a roundabout
water route to the same goal&mdash;a goal fortified
by the line of British forts on the
Lakes. Here encouragement of every description
was to be had at all times&mdash;at
the price of steadily resisting and ravaging
the advancing American frontier line.</p>

<p>The three rivers, the Scioto and the two
Miamis, offered thoroughfare from this
vantage ground southward toward the Kentucky
stations. The important Indian
towns were located on the upper waters of
the Little Miami, the Auglaize, and Maumee,
with other villages on the portages
between these streams and in the lower
valleys of the Auglaize and Maumee.
The largest Indian villages were the settlements
at the junctions of the Maumee and
Auglaize and the St. Mary and St. Joseph.
The key of the region was the junction of
the St. Mary with the St. Joseph&mdash;four
water avenues, leading east (Maumee), west
(Wabash), south (St. Mary), and north (St.
Joseph), and each filled with Indian clearings
and villages.</p>

<p>The land was covered with a network of
Indian trails running in every direction, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
which surprisingly little can be definitely
stated. Considering how numerous are the
old-time maps which show the roads of the
red-men in eastern and central Ohio and in
Kentucky, it is remarkable that almost none
give the routes in western Ohio and eastern
Indiana. By comparison of contemporaneous
authorities it is certain there were
three important landward thoroughfares
leading northward from the Ohio River
into the region here under view. In general
terms, the most easterly of these
ascended the valley of the Little Miami;
another passed northward on the watershed
between the two Miamis; the third ran
north from the present site of Cincinnati
on the watershed to the west of the Great
Miami, with branches running into and up
the river valley itself. All of these routes
led to the strategic portages which connected
the two Miamis and the Scioto with
the St. Mary and Auglaize tributaries of
the Maumee.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The unfortunate Bowman expedition of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
1779<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> went up the Little Miami to the
Shawanese villages along that river. In
the year following George Rogers Clark
waged his campaign against the celebrated
Shawanese town of Piqua on the Mad River
tributary of the Little Miami, cutting a
road for his packhorses and mounted six-pounder
on the east side of the Little
Miami.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Two years later Clark executed
one of the most successful campaigns yet
made into the region north of the Ohio.
Moving from near the mouth of the Licking
(the usual place of rendezvous of all
the Kentucky expeditions into Ohio) it is
believed the expedition took the central
track between the Miamis, reaching the
Great Miami near the site of Dayton. From
thence the route was up that river to the
portage. &ldquo;The British trading-post,&rdquo;
wrote Clark to the governor of Virginia,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
&ldquo;at the head of the Miami and carrying-place
to the waters of the lake shared the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
same fate [as the towns Clark attacked in
person] at the hands of a party of one hundred
and fifty horse, commanded by
Colonel Benjamin Logan.&rdquo; This post was,
undoubtedly, historic Loramie&rsquo;s Store, the
trading-post on Loramie&rsquo;s Creek, Shelby
County, Ohio, at the southern end of the
portage to the St. Mary River.</p>

<p>Thus after a number of years of fighting,
the Kentuckians had at last struck at the
vital spot. This blow ended the Revolutionary
warfare in the West. The British
having lost, some time ago, the war in the
East, had until now assisted the Indians in
an attempt to retrieve the situation by ousting
the brave pioneers from the West. The
presence of the hero of Vincennes so far
north as the portage to the St. Mary and
Auglaize was proof enough that their hope
of conquest in the West was idle.</p>

<p>But hope would not down, and much of
the hard story to which these pages are to
be devoted would never have had a part in
American history had the British now,
once for all, given up the design of countenancing
the Indians in an attempt to
hem in and push back the frontiers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
expanding America. The contest until
now, 1783, had been one solely of retaliation
on the part of the Kentuckians; by
treaties, oft confirmed, the Indians had
given up all title and claim to the lands
south of the Ohio River. From 1785, when
the treaty of Fort McIntosh was made with
the Wyandot, Delaware, Chippewa, and
Ottawa nations, and 1786, when the treaty
of Fort Finney was made with the Shawanese,
the United States ceded to these
Indians all the lands lying between the
Muskingum and Wabash Rivers north of a
line drawn from Fort Laurens to the Miami-St.
Mary portage and thence to the mouth
of River de la Panse on the Wabash.</p>

<p>The northern valley of the Ohio River,
for a long distance into the interior, now
coming into the possession of the United
States, the inevitable struggle to hold it
drew on apace. The tribes of the Miamis
nation, Twightwees or Miamis proper,
Weas or Ouiatenons, Piankeshaws, and
Shockeys, on the upper Wabash, being
troublesome, George Rogers Clark moved
northward from Vincennes with nearly a
thousand troops in the fall of 1786; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Clark&rsquo;s deportment was demoralizing and
his campaign was a practical failure. However,
before starting on the Wabash campaign,
Clark had ordered Colonel Logan to
strike again at the towns at the head of the
Great Miami. With four or five hundred
mounted riflemen Logan accomplished the
task of destroying eight Indian villages
and taking several score of prisoners.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The foregoing details form a necessary
introduction to the new era in the West,
heralded by the passage of the Ordinance of
1787 and the forming of the government of
the Territory Northwest of the Ohio River
at Marietta July 16, 1788. Until this time
the question of western defense had been
a problem for Pennsylvania and Virginia
to solve by means of their frontier militia.
Now the United States Government took
up the tangled problem, by empowering
President Washington, on September 29,
1789, to call out the militia of the frontier
states to repel the incursions of the savages.</p>

<p>From the time of the organization of the
Northwest Territory until 1790, the Indians
of the Maumee region steadily increased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
their marauding expeditions, striking at
every point along the Ohio River from the
mouth of the Scioto to the mouth of the
Wabash. The Government was overwhelmed
with petitions and remonstrances
from citizens of all classes in Kentucky.
Judge Innes addressed the Secretary of War
from Kentucky: &ldquo;I have been intimately
acquainted with this district from November
1783.... I can venture to say, that
above 1500 souls have been killed and taken
in the district, and migrating to it; that
upwards of 20,000 horses have been
taken ... and other property ... carried
off and destroyed by these barbarians,
to at least &pound;15,000.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The ringleaders of these marauding bands
were the Miami tribes of the upper Wabash
and Miami Rivers, and Shawanese who
dwelt with them. The Delawares and
Wyandots, who now, in 1789, signed the
Treaty of Fort Harmar (which only confirmed
the previous treaties of Fort Stanwix
and Fort McIntosh) were not, at first,
guilty of connivance; though soon they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
joined the Indian confederacy regardless of
their promises.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note at the outset that
the savages to whom the attention of the
nation was now about to be attracted were
styled, generally, the &ldquo;Northwestern
Indians.&rdquo; The significance of this is that
now, when at last run to bay, the final campaigns
in that long series of conflicts begun
by Washington and Braddock and Forbes on
the heads of the Ohio (1754-58), continued
by Bouquet on the Muskingum (1764),
Dunmore on the Scioto (1774), Crawford
on the Sandusky (1781), and Clark on the
Miami (1782), were to be fought to a triumphant
conclusion in the region of the
Wabash. These savages were the same
that had ever fought the advancing fire-line
of civilization&mdash;the Miamis, Delawares,
Shawanese, Wyandots, and their confederates.
Driven westward for nearly half a
century, they made a final stand at the
western extremity of Lake Erie, almost
under the guns of the British forts, and are
known collectively now in 1790 as the
&ldquo;Northwestern Indians.&rdquo; The story of
our actual conquest of the interior of Amer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>ica
from the aboriginal inhabitants is
practically the story of the campaigns
which resulted in the acquisition successively
of the Allegheny, Beaver, Muskingum,
Scioto, Miami, Maumee, and Wabash
river valleys. Fallen Timber sealed the
doom of the Indian and ended a struggle
begun at Fort Necessity in 1754. The
conquest would not have taken one-half the
time it did had the Indian not become
allied now to France and now to England,
alliances which introduced perplexing and
delicate international questions which prolonged
the pitiful struggle.</p>

<p>On the sixth of October, 1789, President
Washington, acting under the new powers
conferred upon him, addressed a communication
to Governor St. Clair requesting
accurate information as to whether or not
&ldquo;the Wabash and Illinois Indians are most
inclined for war or peace.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> If found to
favor the former course the governor was
empowered &ldquo;to call on the lieutenants of
the nearest counties of Virginia and Pennsylvania,
for such detachments of militia as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
you may judge proper, not exceeding, however,
one thousand from Virginia and five
hundred from Pennsylvania.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> With the
prophetic foresight which so frequently
marked Washington&rsquo;s estimate of the future
he added: &ldquo;As it may be of high importance
to obtain a precise and accurate knowledge
of the several waters which empty
into the Ohio, on the northwest, and of
those which discharge themselves in the
lakes Erie and Michigan, the length of the
portage between, and nature of the ground,
an early and pointed attention thereto is
earnestly recommended.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Anthony Gamelin,
a trusty scout, was sent up the
Wabash River to test the sentiments of the
Wabash and Miami Indians in April 1790;
the gist of his report was that the young
men of the nations could not be restrained
from war, that the majority of the savages
had &ldquo;a bad heart.&rdquo; The influence of
McKee and Girty was in absolute authority.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
&ldquo;I now enclose the proceedings of Mr.
Gamelin,&rdquo; wrote Major Hamtramck to Gov<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>ernor
St. Clair from Vincennes, May 22,
1790, &ldquo;by which your excellency can have
no great hopes of bringing the Indians to a
peace with the United States.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The reasons
are thus stated by Governor St. Clair
to the Secretary of War: &ldquo;The confidence
these [Indians] have in their situation, the
vicinity of many other nations, either much
under their influence, or hostilely disposed
towards the United States, and pernicious
councils of the British traders, joined to the
immense booties obtained by their depredations
on the Ohio.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>By July 16 Governor St. Clair was ready
to put in motion the campaign which was
voted by all concerned to be inevitable.
There was a double danger in further
delay; the Indians were growing more bold
each day, and the people along the western
frontier were beginning to distrust the
strength of the Government which, while
claiming them, failed utterly to protect
them. Only a week before (July 7) Judge
Innes wrote these startling words to the
Secretary of War: &ldquo;I will, sir, be candid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
on this subject.... The people say they
have long groaned under their misfortunes,
they see no prospect of relief.... They
begin to want faith in the Government, and
appear determined to revenge themselves:
for this purpose a meeting was lately held
in this place, by a number of respectable
characters, to determine on the propriety
of carrying on three expeditions this
fall.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly by circular letters to the
county lieutenants dated Fort Washington,
July 16, 1790, St. Clair called upon three
hundred men from Nelson, Lincoln, and
Jefferson Counties, Virginia, to rendezvous
at Fort Steuben (Steubenville, Ohio) September
12; seven hundred men from
Madison, Mercer, Fayette, Bourbon, Woodford,
and Mason Counties to rendezvous at
Fort Washington September 15; and five
hundred men from Washington, Fayette,
Westmoreland, and Allegheny Counties,
Pennsylvania, to rendezvous four miles
below Wheeling on September 3. From
this on affairs moved swiftly. On July
14&mdash;the day before the circular letters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
were sent off&mdash;General Harmar contracted
with Elliott and Williams of Kentucky for
one hundred and eighty thousand rations
of flour, two hundred thousand rations of
meat, eight hundred and sixty-eight horses
equipped, one horse-master general, eighteen
horse-masters, one hundred and thirty
drivers, to be delivered at Fort Washington
by October 1. On August 23, Secretary of
War Knox wrote Governor St. Clair that
he had ordered two tons of best rifle and
musket powder, four tons of lead bullets,
cartridge paper, case shot for five and a
half inch howitzers and for three- and six-pounders
to be hurried on from Philadelphia
to the Ohio River. A thousand dollars
was forwarded to Fort Washington for
contingent expenses. Knox hurried a
letter on to the governor of Virginia asking
him to use his influence to induce the
veteran Kentucky colonels Logan and
Shelby to join the army at Fort Washington
as volunteers for &ldquo;the accomplishment
of the public good,&rdquo; and a letter to Harmar
requesting him to invite &ldquo;those characters,&rdquo;
and to treat them with &ldquo;the greatest
cordiality.&rdquo; St. Clair wrote immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
to the British commander at Detroit explaining
candidly the nature of the campaign
now on foot, explicitly stating its object
and asking that the enemy should receive
no assistance from British traders &ldquo;from
whose instigation,&rdquo; he made bold to add,
&ldquo;there is good reason to believe, much of
the injuries committed by the savages has
proceeded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everything considered, the young government
responded nobly to the call of its
western citizens. This was its first war,
and one has to know only a little of the
struggles for mere equipoise and maintenance
since the close of the Revolution
to realize that a war at this time, of any
proportions, was a most trying and exhausting
undertaking. This has never been
sufficiently emphasized. His first inauguration
now two years past, the labors of
his new honors were already bearing heavily
upon the first president. If greater
trials had ever been his portion, even in
the struggle for independence, they had in
a measure been anticipated and borne with
a patience commensurate with the great
interests at stake. He had been able to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
man&#339;uver his armies from red-coat generals&rsquo;
grasp, and the fretful complainings
of the &ldquo;times that tried men&rsquo;s souls&rdquo; were
alternately hushed in the presence of gloom
and scattered in the hour of victory. But
now the clash of personal interest and state
pride rose loud about the chief executive,
and advisers, who had once lost all thought
of self in the common danger, now became
uncertain quantities in the struggle for
personal advancement, and bickered spitefully
over matters of preferment and policy.
The country which Washington loved never
needed his services more than now when
these untried problems of currency, debt,
and policy&mdash;and now of war&mdash;came rapidly
to the front.</p>

<p>The President&rsquo;s call for militia was
answered with too great alacrity. A motley
collection of Kentucky militia was
assembling by the middle of September,
and those from Pennsylvania reached Fort
Washington on the twenty-fourth. The
Kentuckians were formed into three battalions
under Majors Hall, M&rsquo;Mullen, and
Bay, commanded by Lieutenant-colonel
Trotter&mdash;under whom they were anxious to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
serve. The Pennsylvanians were formed
in one battalion under Lieutenant-colonel
Trubley and Major Pond, the whole commanded
by Colonel John Hardin, subject to
General Harmar&rsquo;s orders. The regulars
were formed in two battalions under Major
John P. Wyllys and Major John Doughty.
The company of artillery, having three
pieces of ordnance, was under the command
of Captain William Ferguson. A
battalion of flying militia or light mounted
troops was commanded by Major James
Fontaine. The entire army numbered one
thousand four hundred and fifty-three, of
which three hundred and twenty were
regulars. The &ldquo;army&rdquo; had assembled
quickly; the stores had been forwarded to
the place of rendezvous with exceeding
despatch and faithfulness. The army was
fatally weak in two particulars: many
undisciplined old men and boys had volunteered
as substitutes; and the arms, furnished
by the volunteers themselves, were
in lamentably poor condition. Taken all
in all, with the exception of armament,
which was somewhat bettered at Fort Washington,
this first little American army that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
now began an invasion of the Maumee
Valley was in no better or no worse condition
than the ordinary militia forces
formerly put into the field by Pennsylvania
or Kentucky.</p>

<p>On the twenty-sixth of September the
militia, eleven hundred strong, under
Colonel Hardin, set forth from Fort Washington,
striking in a northwesterly direction
toward the valley of the Little Miami, on
General Clark&rsquo;s route of 1780. David H.
Morris, making a slight error in dates,
leaves this account, which gives, as the
first day&rsquo;s march of the militia, four miles:
&ldquo;On the 29th of September, we took up
our march for the Maumee Villages, near
where Fort Wayne now stands, and proceeded
four miles.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the start from Fort Washington
Thomas Irwin leaves record: &ldquo;My Second
visit to Said Cincinnati was as a volunteer
from Washington, Pa. on Harmars Campaign
about the first week in October
1790.... Fort Washington was Built,
not finished, in my absence. The Militia
from Kentucky and Pennsylvania Rendezvoused
There at the same time Marched
from Thence for the Indian Towns Between
the 10th and 15th of october 1790 on the
Trace made By General Clark from Kentucky
in october 1782<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> which crossed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
river hill<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> north of Fort Washington
passed Mcmillins<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Spring as it was afterwards
Called Encamped at reading until
Harmar came up with the regular Troops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the beginning of the last century
Harmar&rsquo;s route was easily traced through
Warren County, running north of Mason
and west of Lebanon.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> On September 30
the regulars under General Harmar left
Fort Washington, by way of the same route,
it would seem, as the militia. Captain
Armstrong&rsquo;s record for the day reads:
&ldquo;The army moved from Fort Washington,
at halfpast ten o&rsquo;clock, A. M.,&mdash;marched
about seven miles N. E. course&mdash;hilly, rich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
land. Encamped on a branch of Mill
creek.&rdquo; How one can understand from
this record that Harmar&rsquo;s route followed
what later became known as the &ldquo;old
Wayne Road&rdquo; or &ldquo;old Hamilton Road&rdquo;
up Mill Creek Valley is beyond the ken of
the present writer. Encamping on the
night of September 2 on Muddy Creek,
Warren County, General Harmar lay one
mile south of the militia encampment.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
On the day following he moved through
Hardin&rsquo;s camp, which was located a few
miles southwest of Lebanon, and rested
one mile in advance on Turtle Creek.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Here the divisions of the army united, and
here the line of march was formed, according
to Armstrong&rsquo;s journal, on September 3.</p>

<p>A. H. Dunlevy, a pioneer in this neighborhood
west of Lebanon in 1798, left
record that near his home on the old route
was the site of one of Harmar&rsquo;s camps&mdash;possibly
that of Colonel Hardin. A half
acre was cleared and several graves were
then visible there. &ldquo;The brush,&rdquo; he
wrote, &ldquo;was piled in heaps around the
camp. These brush heaps were decayed
in 1798 but made fine harbors for snakes
and as the warm sun of spring came out, I
think hundreds of them could be seen in an
hour passing from one brush heap to
another. I used to amuse myself in watching
their movements and noting their
peculiar colors. Every kind of snake
seemed to nestle together in those brush
heaps.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>On the fourth the combined army moved
in a northwesterly direction through the
Turtle Creek Valley and, continuing over
the hilly region northeast of Lebanon,
crossed the Little Miami at what has long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
been known as Fish-pot Ford about six
miles northeast of Lebanon.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Moving up
the east bank of the river, camp was pitched
one mile north of the crossing-place on
C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s Creek.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The route the day following
was up the river on the famous war
path toward the Indian Chillicothe and
Piqua towns in the valleys of that and the
Mad River, along the general alignment of
the Little Miami Railroad. Marching ten
miles, according to Captain Armstrong, the
army encamped &ldquo;at five o&rsquo;clock on Glade
creek, a very lively, clear stream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the sixth, the site of old Chillicothe
was reached; &ldquo;recrossed the Little Miami,&rdquo;
says Armstrong, &ldquo;at half past one o&rsquo;clock,
halted one hour, and encamped at four
o&rsquo;clock on a branch.&rdquo; Morris&rsquo;s account
from the thirtieth of September reads:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
&ldquo;Thirtieth, we moved forward on the old
Indian trail leading to the old Chilcothie
town, on the little Miami, and after several
days marching, arrived at the place where
the town once stood. Here we fired off our
guns; and in the evening, having recrossed
the river, encamped about a mile above,
near where James Galloway now lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old Indian trail ran from Chillicothe
to Old Piqua across Mad River Township,
Clark County, where, five miles west of
Springfield, Tecumseh was born. After
Clark&rsquo;s destruction of this village in 1780,
its inhabitants moved across to the Great
Miami where New Piqua was built, and
which was destroyed by Clark in 1782.
The path Harmar now followed bore toward
the northwest, taking him to the site of the
later Piqua on the Great Miami. Armstrong&rsquo;s
journal reads: &ldquo;7<sup>th</sup>.... Passed
through several low praries, and crossed
the Pickaway fork of Mad river.... Encamped
on a small branch, one mile from
the former. Our course the first four miles
north, then northwest.&mdash;Nine miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Irwin MS., from the point of union
of Harmar and Harding, reads: &ldquo;formed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the Line of march there which was in Two
Lines one on the right and one on the Left
of s<sup>d</sup> Trace a strong front and Rear guard
on Said Trace the Baggage in the Center
Passed near where the Town of Lebanon
Stands in Warren County west of Waynesville
and Xenia Crossed Mad river perhaps
10 miles from Dayton Struck the great
Miami near the old Piqua Towns that was
Detroyed By s<sup>d</sup> Gen<sup>l</sup>. Clark Crossed the
Miami some Distance above Them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the journey between the two Miamis
the Morris journal is perhaps most definite:
&ldquo;On the day following, we crossed Mad
river, and camped near New Carlisle,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> in
Clark county, and within one mile of Epee
town, located precisely where Elnathan
Cory now lives. This town gave name to
the creek on which it stood, now called
Honey-creek.... Here we killed 20
cows intended for beef.... The next
day we crossed Indian creek ... and
same day crossed Lost Creek in Miami
county.... On this evening, we encamped
at a spring, on the farm formerly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
owned by Nathaniel Gerrard, and about
two miles from the town of Troy. Gen.
Harmar gave to this spring, the name <i>Tea
Spring</i>, as he and his officers refreshed
themselves there, on that beverage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong&rsquo;s record for the eighth and
ninth is: &ldquo;The army moved at halfpast
nine o&rsquo;clock. Passed over rich land, in
some places a little broken: passed several
ponds, and through one small prarie, a N.
W. course.&mdash;Seven miles. 9th&mdash;The army
moved at halfpast nine o&rsquo;clock. Passed
through a level, rich country, well watered:
course N. W.,&mdash;halted halfpast four
o&rsquo;clock, two miles south of the Great
Miami.&mdash;Ten miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These commonplace records do not in
any way represent the real state of affairs;
perhaps they suggest only the topics of conversation
of the vanguard of scouts and
guides that led the army. The little band
of troops was now in the heart of the
enemy&rsquo;s country. The face of the land
was covered with forests, broken here and
there by patches of bush and prairie. That
the Indians knew of their advance, there
was little doubt. When, where, or how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
they would oppose that advance, no one
knew. The Great Miami was now reached
and soon the strategic portage of the St.
Mary would be taken possession of. The
course would then be down grade to the
Miami towns on the Maumee. Would the
enemy rally here on the watershed crest
near the old French fort on the Loramie?
Such speculations as these occupied many
more minds, it may confidently be believed,
than thoughts of the streams or prairies
crossed. The records left us tell only of
the commonplaces, leaving the human element
to the imagination. Yet this can be
better conceived if the route is correctly
outlined.</p>

<p>On the tenth of September Harmar crossed
the Great Miami River. &ldquo;At the crossing,&rdquo;
wrote Armstrong, &ldquo;there is a handsome
high prairie on the S. E. side.&rdquo; &ldquo;On
the following day,&rdquo; reads the Morris record,
&ldquo;we crossed the big Miami, a little
above the town of Piqua, near Manning&rsquo;s
old mill.... This evening we encamped
not far from upper Piqua.&rdquo; This agrees
with the Irwin MS. previously quoted.</p>

<p>On the eleventh the army moved to and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
crossed Loramie&rsquo;s Creek, seven miles from
its camping-place of the preceding night
(ten miles from the camp near the Great
Miami of September 9). Of the route from
the Great Miami onward, Irwin states:
&ldquo;Crossed Loirimous Creek a short Distance
from its mouth into the great Miami river
had a pretty good Indian Trace from there
to what was Called the old french store or
Trading house at St marys had a good Trace
from there to the Maumee towns.&rdquo; The
Morris record reads: &ldquo;Next day, we took
up our march for Lorrimiers, a French
trader at St. Marys&mdash;... We crossed
Lorrimie creek on the next morning, at a
village that had been burned by Clark or
Logan, some ten years before. From here,
we passed over the summit level for St.
Marys, where we encamped.... Having
crossed St. Marys we encamped on its eastern
bank.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>On September 12, by Armstrong&rsquo;s jour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>nal,
the army &ldquo;crossed a stream at seven
miles and a half running N. E. on which
there are several old camps, much deadened
timber, which continues to the river Auglaize,
about a mile. Here has been a
considerable village&mdash;some houses still
standing. This stream is a branch of the
Omi [Maumee] river, and is about twenty
yards wide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this on the route was along the old
trace which followed the St. Mary, some
distance to the northward of the immediate
bank, to its junction with the Maumee,
where the army arrived on the seventeenth
of September, having accomplished the
hard march of over one hundred and sixty
miles in eighteen days by the regulars and

<p>On the thirteenth, &ldquo;I think the 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>d</sup>

to Mr. Irwin, &ldquo;8 or 10 mounted men

<p>Signs that the Indians had retreated in a
northwesterly direction being discovered,
General Harmar, on the eighteenth, ordered
Colonel Trotter of the militia to follow and
attack them with a force of three hundred
men. The detachment was provided with
three days rations. About one mile from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
camp an Indian was pursued and killed.
A little later a second solitary Indian scout
was killed&mdash;after wounding one of his
assailants. Trotter moved hither and
thither with apparent aimlessness until
nightfall when he returned to camp&mdash;to
Harmar&rsquo;s disgust. The militia in camp had
scattered in various directions searching for
corn and other plunder which the savages
had buried. The gun fired to call these
into camp, Trotter affirmed, was thought
to be an alarm signal for him to return.
The men under Trotter displayed no more
military characteristics than the prowling
militia left at the encampment. Such men,
it was sure, would suffer at the hands of
the fierce, watchful enemy, if ever their turn
should come.</p>

<p>It came on the very next day! It was
now Colonel Hardin&rsquo;s turn to strike a blow,
and he was ordered out on the Indian path
which ran northwest toward the Kickapoo
towns. Proceeding about eleven miles
from camp (Fort Wayne, Indiana) to near
the point where the Goshen state road
crosses the Eel River, the keen scouter John
Armstrong saw important &ldquo;signs&rdquo; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
heard an alarm gun in front. Hardin did
not act on the advice and made no disposition
of his troops for battle. Soon after,
Armstrong discovered the fires of the Indian
camp&mdash;but Hardin, scorning the enemy,
pushed straight on. The Indian commander&mdash;the
famous Miami warrior, Little
Turtle&mdash;based his plans on just such recklessness.
Deep in the brush and grass on
either side of the trail his dogs of war
crouched silent as cougars. The army
had walked well into the trap before two
crimson streaks of fire flashed out in the
very faces of the troopers. The militia
bolted at breakneck speed&mdash;some never
stopping in their flight until they reached
the Ohio River. A small band of regulars
under Armstrong retired slightly and held
their ground temporarily; then they
retreated to Harmar&rsquo;s camp. This savage
stroke cost heavily, the Indians killing
almost an average of a white man apiece&mdash;the
loss, about one hundred, equalling,
probably, the number of the waylaying
savage force. It was one of the bloodiest
ambuscades in western history. Armstrong&rsquo;s
journal for the nineteenth reads:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
&ldquo;Attacked about one hundred Indians
fifteen miles west of the Miami village;
and from the dastardly conduct of the militia,
the troops were obliged to retreat. I
lost one sergeant, and twenty-one out of
thirty men of my command. The Indians
on this occasion gained a complete victory&mdash;having
killed, in the whole, near one
hundred men, which was about their number.
Many of the militia threw away their
arms without firing a shot, ran through the
federal troops and threw them in disorder.&rdquo;
Of the Indians Armstrong adds &ldquo;they
fought and died hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Hardin&rsquo;s troops returned, they
found that Harmar had moved two miles
down the Maumee in the work of destroying
the Indian villages and crops. From
this camp, an old Shawanese village, various
companies were sent out in different directions
to finish the work of destroying the
Indian settlements. On the night of the
twenty-first, when seven miles distant from
the Miami village, Colonel Hardin proposed
to Harmar that he be allowed his pick of
the militia with which to return secretly
upon the Indians. It was believed, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
spies no doubt so reported, that the Indians
had returned to their central villages at the
junction of the St. Mary and St. Joseph.
Harmar acquiesced, feeling that another
blow would undoubtedly prevent the savages
from following the army.</p>

<p>The force was composed of three hundred
and forty militia, under Majors Hall
and McMullen, Major Fontaine&rsquo;s mounted
militia, and sixty regulars under Major
Wyllys. The Miami town was reached
after sunrise. Hardin&rsquo;s plan was to surround
secretly the village and make a
simultaneous attack from all sides. Major
Hall&rsquo;s battalion was sent to cross the St.
Mary and hold themselves in readiness to
attack from the rear when the main body,
which would cross the Maumee at the common
ford, fell upon the village in front.
Hall&rsquo;s men wantonly fired on a fugitive
Indian before the signal for attack was
given; to make matters worse the militia
under McMullen and Fontaine began pursuing
the various parties of flying redskins,
leaving Major Wyllys and the regulars unsupported.
The latter crossed the Maumee,
according to the fixed scheme, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
were suddenly assailed by an overpowering
force led by Little Turtle and were compelled
to return with loss of many men,
including Major Wyllys himself. The
militia then hastened back to the main
army. Miserable as had been the deportment
of the militia, their muskets had done
severe execution, and Harmar had no fear
now of an Indian attack&mdash;nor the slightest
remnant of confidence in any but the fragment
of regular troops left to him.</p>

<p>On the twenty-third the army took up
the line of outward march for Fort Washington
and reached the Ohio on the fourth
day of November, having lost one hundred
and eighty-three killed and thirty-one
wounded. Major Wyllys and Lieutenant
Frothingham of the regulars, and Major
Fontaine and Captains Thorp, McMurtrey,
and Scott, and Lieutenants Clark and
Rogers of the militia were the principal
officers sacrificed.</p>

<p>On the other hand there is ground for
partly agreeing with Irwin that Harmar&rsquo;s
campaign was not wholly a defeat. The
Indian loss was as large as the American&mdash;and
this was a great deal accomplished.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Few armies before had entered the Indian
land and not been followed by the Indians
on the return with distinct losses. Harmar&rsquo;s
repeated though costly operations on
the Maumee had given the Indians all the
battle they wished; indeed it is not too
much to say that they were stunned.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>ST. CLAIR&rsquo;S CAMPAIGN</h3>


<p>Harmar wrought wide destruction
but of the kind that made the
Indians of the Maumee irrevocably
and bitterly angry. The main boast of the
returning campaigners was that the enemy
did not pursue them&mdash;which, after all,
was more significant than we can realize
today. It illustrates in a word the exact
effect of the raid; the Indians were dumbfounded
at the arrival of a white army so
far within their forests. They knew as
well as the whites that the punishment
administered to the frontiersmen was almost
wholly due to the rash boldness of the
latter, who, rushing heedlessly after the
scurrying savages, made ambuscades possible.
Yet Harmar&rsquo;s actual success was
only in burning villages and crops, and
sending crowds of old men and women and
children fleeing to the swamps and forest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
fastnesses. Practically, it was the old story
of a score of Kentucky raids into the
&ldquo;Indian side&rdquo; of the Ohio over again.
&ldquo;You are the &lsquo;town-destroyer,&rsquo;&rdquo; was the
cry of an old chieftain to President Washington,
&ldquo;and when that name is heard our
women look quickly behind them and turn
pale.&rdquo; But there was something more to
be done on the Maumee than to make
squaws turn pale! That would not keep
back the murdering bands from the infant
settlements along and below the Ohio.</p>

<p>This became plain so suddenly that the
shock was felt throughout the East. In no
way could the Northwestern Indians have
struck home more quickly than by perpetrating
the terrible Big Bottom Massacre.
The New England colony which, led by
Rufus Putnam, founded Marietta at the
mouth of the Muskingum had, by January
1790, expanded in all directions.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> One
company of pioneers had ascended the Muskingum
to Big Bottom, Morgan County,
Ohio. At dusk, on the second night in
January, 1791, a band of savages crossed
the river at Silverheels Riffle above the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
unprotected blockhouse, and entered the
settlement feigning friendship. The
pioneers offered them a portion of the evening
meal, when a sudden burst of flame
swept the room. Several whites fell
straight forward into the fireplace before
which they were eating; others, to the
number of fourteen, were instantly put to
death. But one blow was struck by the
whites at Big Bottom. The goodwife of
the woodsman Meeks, uninjured by the
first fire that swept the cabin, took advantage
of the cloud of smoke to seize a broad-ax
standing by the wall. As an Indian
strode forward to the bloody finale, the
glittering blade sank deeply into his shoulder.
It was but one blow&mdash;but it was a
token of a Nation&rsquo;s anger; it meant as
much as the blood-red battle-ax the departing
murderers left beside the smouldering
ruins of Big Bottom blockhouse.</p>

<p>The message of that war-club sped eastward.
The blow at the New England
colony was sure to attract unusual attention,
and no doubt played an important part in
deciding the great question of the hour.
This was a question of war or peace. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
in the year previous, so now in 1791 (as
well as in later times) there were many who
opposed Indian warfare from humanitarian
principles. Suffice it to say these opponents
of war did not live on the Muskingum
or Licking Rivers! Yet peace, for all concerned,
if it could be secured at an honorable
price, was most desirable, and the
United States faced the question fairly and
with energy. As early as December, 1790,
the famous Seneca chieftain Cornplanter,
being in Philadelphia, was urged not only
to present the exact feeling of the Government
to the Six Nations in New York and
on the Allegheny, but was asked to visit
the hostile western nations as a peace messenger.
The declaration of war by the
savages at Big Bottom in no wise deterred
the United States from this purpose of
obtaining peace at the least price in blood
and treasure. In March, 1791, Colonel
Thomas Proctor was sent to the Senecas to
urge the young men of that tribe not to
take the war path, and then was ordered to
go with Cornplanter to the Maumee River.
The task was dangerous and laborious, but
Proctor pushed his way through the forests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
of Pennsylvania and New York to the Senecas
who kept so well the western door of
the &ldquo;Long House of the Iroquois.&rdquo; It
was a fruitless mission. &ldquo;The people at
the setting sun are bad people,&rdquo; said an old
warrior to the intrepid herald; &ldquo;you must
look when it is light in the morning until
the setting sun, and you must reach your
neck over the land, and take all the light
you can, to show the danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Senecas were right and the further
Proctor &ldquo;reached his neck out&rdquo; over the
land the more plainly was this seen to be
true. Gordon, the British commander at
Niagara, forbade him taking ship for the
Maumee; &ldquo;the unfriendly denial,&rdquo; he
wrote the Secretary of War, &ldquo;puts a stop to
the further attempting to go to the Miamies.&rdquo;
Another item in his letter was
of significance: Joseph Brant with forty
warriors had gone westward to the confederated
tribes on an unknown mission.</p>

<p>In April, Colonel Timothy Pickering was
also sent to the Senecas, and, meeting them
in convention at Painted Post, urged the
chieftains to hold back the young men from
joining the hostile tribes. Governor St.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Clair likewise sent messages, especially to
the western tribes urging that hostile bands
be withdrawn from the frontier ere the
United States should be compelled to bring
heavy chastisement. But peace is sometimes
as costly, and more so, than war;
such proved to be the case now. It was
early believed by the most farsighted that
a crushing defeat of the northwestern confederacy
would be a great saving of blood.
And so while peaceful efforts were being
forwarded as effectually as the situation of
the distant tribes and the hostility of English
agents permitted, warlike preparations
were likewise being made. As the spring
of 1791 opened, the frontiers were overrun
with murderous bands and the cry from the
infant West to the central government
could not be unheeded. &ldquo;I most earnestly
implore the protection of government,&rdquo;
wrote the brave Putnam to Washington,
&ldquo;for myself and friends inhabiting these
wilds of America.&rdquo; The cry from Kentucky
and the lower Ohio was equally piercing.</p>

<p>The plan of the United States at this
juncture was wholly in keeping with its
dignity and its power. Failing in an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
attempt of reconciliation, it was determined
to throw into the Indian land several raiding
bands of horsemen &ldquo;to demonstrate that
they [the savages] were within our reach,
and lying at our mercy.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> In case these
strokes did not awe the offenders, a grand
campaign on an extensive scale was to be
inaugurated. Fearing the worst, though
hopeful of the better, preparations for all
these movements were put on foot, to be
countermanded if peaceful measures sufficed.
The attitude of the Government at
this serious crisis of its first Indian war
must be judged humane and generous.
The Indians protested that they had never
ceded an inch of territory northwest of the
Ohio; yet at four treaties supposed representatives
of all the nations concerned had
received from American commissioners
payment for all lands now (1791) occupied
or claimed by the white men. In each case
the nations had been formally invited to
each treaty; they now averred that only
irresponsible chieftains had signed these
treaties. In a single instance it is possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
to believe that unscrupulous Indians might
have so deceived the government officials
and wronged the Indians, but that this
could have occurred on three occasions was
manifestly absurd. The Ohio Company
purchase and the Symmes purchase had
been made, the pioneers had emigrated and
settled the lands. The Government had
given no white man right to cross the treaty
line. Those settlements could not be uprooted
without great injustice. The war
seemed, therefore, an imperative necessity,
and the Government had no honorable alternative
if peace efforts failed. We have had
many dealings with the Indians since 1790,
and it is of some comfort to rest assured
that our first Indian war was eminently
just and right.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise ordered, Brigadier-general
Scott of Kentucky was to make a dash
at the Indian villages on the upper Wabash
in the early summer. A little later General
Wilkinson was scheduled to lead another
raiding band to the populous settlement on
the Eel River, a northern tributary of the
Wabash. These swift strokes, it was hoped,
would compel the Indians to confer con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>cerning
peace. No rift in the dark war-clouds
occurred, despite the efforts of Knox
and St. Clair to establish an armistice, and
Scott marched northward in May and Wilkinson
in August. Like similar raids, these
two were successful failures. Villages and
crops were ruined and captives were taken.
Many squaws &ldquo;looked behind them and
turned pale&rdquo; perhaps, but in effect they
had an opposite influence from that hoped:
they undid whatever little good the efforts
to secure peace had accomplished. There
was now utmost need for the final &ldquo;grand
campaign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The army of the United States now consisted
of three or four hundred soldiers&mdash;the
First Regiment&mdash;distributed among
the frontier forts on the Ohio River. It
was ordered that the depleted ranks of this
regiment be filled by recruits to be raised
&ldquo;from Maryland to New York inclusive,&rdquo;
and that a full Second Regiment be raised,
one company from South Carolina and one
from Delaware and the remainder in the
four New England states.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The troops
were to be mustered by companies, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
rendezvous at Fort Pitt. Governor Arthur St.
Clair was created Major-general and placed
in command of the new army. Brigadier-general
Richard Butler was appointed
second in command. The object of the
campaign was to establish a line of military
posts from Fort Washington on the Ohio to
the Maumee, where, at the Miami village
at the junction of the St. Mary and St.
Joseph, a strong fort was to be built, &ldquo;for
the purpose of awing and curbing the
Indians in that quarter, and as the only
preventative of future hostilities.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> In
present day terms the army was to march
from Cincinnati, Ohio, and erect a fort on
the site of Fort Wayne, Indiana. In every
order the underlying theory of the Government
is plain&mdash;the one end sought was
peace. &ldquo;This [peace] is of more value
than millions of uncultivated acres,&rdquo; were
the words of the Secretary of War in St.
Clair&rsquo;s instructions.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> It was a war of self-defense,
not a war of conquest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>The business dragged at every point.
In the hope that the Indians would come to
reason, Scott&rsquo;s raid was delayed a week at
the start. Wilkinson, who was to move
northward June 10, did not march until
August 1. The continued anticipation of
good results from these expeditions, which
would render the grand campaign unnecessary,
tended to lessen the energies of the
preparations. General Butler was assigned
the duty of raising the recruits in the
East&mdash;a discouraging task. The pay
offered did not equal an average day&rsquo;s
wage. The campaign was not entirely
popular and promised innumerable hardships.
Enlistments came in slowly, and,
in many instances, only the unfit and unworthy
offered. As late as April 28 the
Secretary of War wrote General Butler:
&ldquo;None of the companies of the Eastern
States are yet nearly completed.&rdquo; As
early as May 12 he wrote St. Clair: &ldquo;It
will at least be the latter end of July, or
the beginning of August before your force
shall be assembled.&rdquo; Originally the army
was to march from Fort Washington on
July 10.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>General St. Clair left Philadelphia March
28 for the Ohio, to superintend affairs at
the point of rendezvous. With &ldquo;a degree
of pain and difficulty that cannot well be
imagined,&rdquo; St. Clair, already a sick man,
pushed on to Pittsburg and Lexington,
Kentucky, reaching Fort Washington on
the fifteenth of May. One week later (May
22) General Butler reached Pittsburg, to
receive the army and the stores and ammunition
and hurry all on to Fort Washington.
But every rod became a mile and every
hundredweight a ton. It was not until the
fifth of June that the troops from the East
reached Fort Pitt&mdash;eight hundred and
forty-two soldiers of the twelve hundred
Secretary Knox had promised May 19.
And yet, few as they were, no boats had
been prepared to carry them south, and
indeed very few in which to transport the
slowly accumulating stores and ammunition.
Contractor Duer and Quartermaster
Samuel Hodgdon seemingly believed that
barges grew on the rich banks of the Ohio
and flat-boats were to be picked from the
trees. The congestion of troops and stores
which now resulted at Pittsburg was quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
as appalling as the former scarcity of every
needful thing. As rapidly as conditions
permitted, General Butler wrought a certain
kind of order out of the chaos, but not
a kind that augured well for the future.
That could hardly have been expected. In
one way or another various craft were
knocked together, filled, and set afloat in
good hope of reaching Fort Washington.
June dragged by, and July. August found
Butler and Quartermaster-general Hodgdon
still at Pittsburg, and it was not until the
twenty-sixth of that month that the last of
the army began the voyage southward&mdash;sixty
precious days late.</p>

<p>On July 21 Secretary Knox wrote St.
Clair at Fort Washington: &ldquo;The president
is greatly anxious that the campaign be
distinguished by decisive measures.&rdquo; A
letter of August 4 reads: &ldquo;The president
still continues anxious that you should, at
the earliest moment, commence your operations;&rdquo;
and another under the date of
September 1 reads: &ldquo;[The president] therefore
enjoins you, by every principle that is
sacred, to stimulate your operations in the
highest degree, and to move as rapidly as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the lateness of the season, and the nature
of the case will possibly admit.&rdquo; It is a
matter of record that at the time this letter
was written neither General Butler or
Quartermaster-general Hodgdon had so
much as reached the rendezvous. The
latter&rsquo;s delay was never explained and
General Butler was utterly dependent upon
quartermaster and contractor. Butler was
at last ordered to Fort Washington by
Secretary Knox in the following peremptory
words, which implied neglect and
carelessness&mdash;a rebuke which was, perhaps,
as undeserved as it was sharp: &ldquo;I have
received your letter of the 18th instant,
which has been submitted to the President
of the United States, and I am commanded
to inform you that he is by no means satisfied
with the long detention of the troops
on the upper parts of the Ohio, which he
considers unnecessary and improper. And
it is his opinion, unless the highest exertions
be made by all parts of the army, to
repair the loss of the season, that the
expenses which have been made for the
campaign, will be altogether lost, and that
the measures, from which so much has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
expected, will issue in disgrace.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> However
the quartermaster-general had been
ordered as early as June 9 to &ldquo;consult
Major General Butler upon all objects of
the preparations and as soon as possible
repair to headquarters.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Yet, had the army been assembled at
Fort Washington July 15 instead of September
5, there would have been no such
thing as moving northward for weeks. No
sooner had the first of the troops reached
St. Clair than it was clear that he had made
no mistake in hurrying to the point of
rendezvous. For instance the carriages of
the guns used in Harmar&rsquo;s campaign were
ruined and had not been replaced. There
was no corps of artificers and drafting was
resorted to in order to secure smiths, carpenters,
harness-makers, wheelwrights, etc.
With the arrival of Major Ferguson, June
20, it became clear that nearly all the am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>munition
had yet to be properly prepared;
a laboratory had to be built; the shells had
to be filled with powder, likewise the artillery
cartridges, the shells for howitzers and
musket cartridges. Not only did enough
of this work have to be done for the immediate
use of the army, but a sufficient
supply had to be prepared for each of the
posts to be erected between Fort Washington
and the Maumee, and to supply the
main fort on the Maumee and its defenders
until spring. The carriages of the guns that
arrived from Philadelphia were rendered
useless and new ones had to be made.
Almost all arms which the troops brought
to Fort Washington were out of repair. An
armory had to be built, and, says General
St. Clair, &ldquo;so fast did the work of that kind
increase upon our hands, that at one time
it appeared as if it would never be got
through with.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>An indeterminate amount of powder
shipped from Philadelphia was practically
ruined before it reached Fort Washington;
one boatload was entirely submerged on
the way from Fort Pitt. The officers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
attempted to keep this from the men but
the news leaked out. &ldquo;The powder was
very bad,&rdquo; records Ensign Pope of the
militia, &ldquo;I fired at a tree several times and
hit but seldom; it would not force the
ball.&rdquo; Such of the powder as was good
stood little chance of remaining so in the
wretched tents that were palmed off on the
quartermaster-general. Colonel Mentgetz,
inspector, is our authority for the fact that,
with the exception of two companies, the
tents would not keep out rain at either
front or back. General Harmar said the
flanks of the tents were of Russian sheeting
and the ends were of crocus or osnaburg
and would not, in his opinion, keep out
rain. According to Major Zeigler the tents
were infamous and &ldquo;many hundred dozen
of cartridges were destroyed, and the
troops, not being kept dry were sick in
great numbers.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The packsaddles were
too big&mdash;&ldquo;big enough for elephants,&rdquo;
said an officer; the axes sent from Philadelphia
were useless&mdash;&ldquo;would bend up
like a dumpling,&rdquo; according to Major
Zeigler. In fact Fort Washington was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
transformed into a manufacturing city, and
there was almost no kind of work that was
not done&mdash;though often the necessary tools
had first to be made. Two traveling forges
had been sent west of which only the anvils
were missing!</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered that St. Clair,
as General Harmar afterward said, was
often the first up in the morning and went
the rounds of the shops and laboratories
greatly disturbed over the vast amount of
work to be done, the difficulty in the doing
of it, and the ominous delay. For, with
the heat of the summer&rsquo;s end, the grass was
fast withering, which meant that feed for
the horses must be transported&mdash;an item
of great magnitude.</p>

<p>The failure of the quartermaster-general
to come forward, even when ordered to do
so, compelled St. Clair to bear the brunt
of all the results of mismanagement and
delay. As noted, the delay of the quartermaster
was never explained. His very
appointment occasioned an outcry among
officers who had known him; the soldiers
laughed many of his measures to scorn.
One of his employees who arrived at Fort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Washington in charge of horses had, seemingly,
no knowledge whatever of frontier
life. The horses were not provided with
hopples or bells; released from their long
confinement in the barges they broke for
the woods and many were never again
secured. St. Clair facetiously hinted that
their master would have had to wear a bell,
had he gone to seek them, in order to be
secure from becoming lost. It was found
later that the horses had been fed, not from
troughs, as ordered, but from the sandy
river beach, where their grain was strewn
and much wasted, the horses also injuring
each other in an attempt to eat it.</p>

<p>But patience is exhausted before one half
of the miserable story is told. More than
enough has been suggested to show the
condition of the &ldquo;grand army&rdquo; that had
gathered and was now about to march
northward. It is almost needless to add
that an eternal jealousy between militia and
regulars existed; that the troops were
wretchedly clad; that nothing was known
of the country through which the march
was to be made, and less than nothing of
the foe that was to be met and conquered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
The camp of the army (except artificers)
was moved by St, Clair on August 7 six
miles northward from Fort Washington to
Ludlow&rsquo;s Station,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> where the pasturage
was better and where the troops were not
under the influence of the dramshops at the
little settlement about the fort.</p>

<p>On the arrival of General Butler and
Quartermaster Hodgdon, September 7, a
slight delay occurred through Butler&rsquo;s
being appointed president of a court-martial
which General Harmar had demanded and
by which he was honorably acquitted. It
was September 17 before the advance was
begun from Ludlow&rsquo;s Station northward.</p>

<p>When the army, twenty-three hundred
strong, at last filed out from Ludlow&rsquo;s Station,
the plan seems to have been to build
two forts between Fort Washington and
the proposed fort on the Maumee, the first
at the ford, twenty-three miles north, on
the Great Miami, and the second about the
same distance in advance and twice as far
from the Maumee.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>The army marched from Ludlow&rsquo;s Station
under the command of General Butler
and reached the Miami September 17. St.
Clair returned to Fort Washington to hurry
up the contractor&rsquo;s agents and muster in
the militia he had called from Kentucky.
From September 17 to October 4 the army
was busy building a fort at &ldquo;Camp Miami,&rdquo;
which St. Clair named Fort Hamilton.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>On October 3 Butler made the last preparations
for the march, Fort Hamilton being
nearly completed. All the artillery cartridges
(except sixty rounds) were distributed,
and one half of the stock of musket
cartridges. A body of contractor&rsquo;s stores
was thrown across the Miami, under cover,
to join the army on its march.</p>

<p>Concerning the route and the road, little
was known. At the outset of the campaign
St. Clair in his instructions was ordered
&ldquo;to appoint some skillful person to make
actual surveys of your march, to be corrected,
if the case will admit of it, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
proper astronomical observations, and of
all posts you may occupy.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The first
settlers in the Miami purchase<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> had spread
inland a few miles at this time; one settlement,
Ludlow&rsquo;s Station, was made five miles
up Mill Creek and another twelve miles up
the Great Miami. Butler&rsquo;s route from
Ludlow&rsquo;s Station to the site of Fort Hamilton
was undoubtedly already an open trail
that far. The day before he advanced from
Fort Hamilton, Butler wrote St. Clair: &ldquo;I
have just received a verbal report from
Captain Ginnon, the surveyor, who is
returned. He has been seven miles, and
says the face of the country is level but very
brushy, and in his opinion it is impracticable
for loaded horses to get on without a
road.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Of this I will be a better judge as I
advance and try the present order of march,
&amp;c. Should I find it impracticable to
execute, I feel confident that any directions
that may be necessary to facilitate the move<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>ments
will meet your approval. The road
is cut one and a-half miles to a good stream
of water and ground to encamp on. Five
miles advanced of that is a large creek,
which is three feet deep at the place he
crossed, but a little below is a ford, ...&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the fourth of October, with enough
provisions to last a few days, without its
commander, who was at Fort Washington
hurrying on three hundred militia, the
army under Butler crossed the Miami River
and entered the shadows of the Indian land.
We have no definite record of the first days&rsquo;
marches. It would not seem that more than
five miles a day were accomplished. The
route was in alignment with the Eaton
Road between Hamilton and Eaton, Preble
County. Four Mile (from Hamilton) Creek&mdash;then
known as Joseph&rsquo;s Creek&mdash;was
crossed near the old &ldquo;Fearnot Mill,&rdquo; and
the first encampment was made near what
was afterward known as Scott&rsquo;s tanyard on
Seven Mile Creek&mdash;then called St. Clair&rsquo;s
Creek.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The line of march was up Seven
Mile Creek, west of Eaton, where the creek
was forded. &ldquo;The trace cannot now be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
definitely located,&rdquo; wrote a Preble County
annalist, a generation ago. &ldquo;It was not
cut to as great width as most of the military
roads, and the line has been almost wholly
obscured by the growth of the forest and
the action of the weather upon the soil.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Narrow as the road here was, it was cut
wider than St. Clair intended. After the
first day or two General Butler, as he suggested
in his letter of October 3, decided
that St. Clair&rsquo;s tri-track plan of march was
impracticable, and gave orders that but one
road should be cut, and that the army march
in a body.</p>

<p>On the seventh St. Clair came hurrying
on from Fort Washington to join his army.
The militia had gone on on the fifth, but
in bad temper. Several deserted even
upon arriving at Fort Washington. A
sergeant and twenty-five men deserted on
the night of the third. A score of men
deserted from Fort Hamilton the night
before the army marched. The anxiety of
the officers, and the herculean efforts to get
the army into fighting trim, had not created
a very loyal spirit in the men who marched.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
A little more chicanery and misjudgment
and the entire army would have mutinied.
St. Clair, before mounting his horse, wrote
Knox that his troops amounted in all to
twenty-three hundred. &ldquo;I trust I shall
find them sufficient,&rdquo; he added. The words
remind one of Braddock&rsquo;s last letter to the
British Ministry before leaving Fort Cumberland
for the death-trap on the Monongahela
in 1755. Major Ebenezer Denny
traveled with St. Clair as aide-de-camp and
has left us the official account of the army&rsquo;s
march. Denny was not anxious to serve.
&ldquo;You must go,&rdquo; General Harmar declared,
&ldquo;some will escape and you may be among
the number.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>St. Clair and Denny reached Fort Hamilton
on the seventh, and on the day following
pushed on after the army over the
narrow course it had made; this was
running &ldquo;north sixteen degrees.&rdquo; Four
encampments were passed and the militia,
and St. Clair reached his army that evening.
There was full need of him. The
army was making but five miles a day;
and at that disastrously slow pace the stores<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
were not keeping up. Tonight (the eighth)
St. Clair wrote a stinging letter to Israel
Ludlow. Instead of having ninety thousand
rations, as was promised, St. Clair had
to write &ldquo;by day after tomorrow I shall not
have an ounce unless some arrives....
If you found the transportation impracticable,
you ought to have informed me, that
I might have taken means to have got supplies
forward, <i>or not have committed my army
to the wilderness</i>.... No disappointment
should have happened which was in the
power of money to prevent; and money
could certainly have prevented any
here.... Want of drivers will be no
excuse to a starving army and a disappointed
people.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Another exceedingly unfortunate affair
demanded St. Clair&rsquo;s attention, in his opinion,
that night. He had given carefully
studied and explicit orders by which the
army should march. As noted, General
Butler changed the order of march as he
threatened to do in his letter to St. Clair
from Fort Hamilton. The reasons for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
change did not appeal to the commander-in-chief;
Butler was called to account for
his action, apologized, and stated his reasons.
St. Clair had ordered that the army march in
three lines, contending that it was far more
easy to cut three roads, ten feet in width
each, than to cut one road of thirty or forty.
St. Clair&rsquo;s method was that pursued by the
wisest and most successful generals&mdash;Forbes
and Bouquet&mdash;in hewing the first
roads across the Alleghenies. &ldquo;The quantity
of timber,&rdquo; St. Clair records, &ldquo;increases
in a surprising proportion, as the width of
the road is increased;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> the veteran conqueror
of Fort Duquesne, General Forbes,
wrote his right-hand man Colonel Bouquet
under the same circumstances, urging the
cutting of several paths, saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
mean here to cut down any large trees,
only to clear away the Brushwood and
saplins....&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Temporarily, St. Clair
allowed Butler&rsquo;s alteration to stand, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
insisted that it should soon be corrected as
the army pushed on.</p>

<p>The result was that Butler conceived an
intense dislike for St. Clair. The latter
has placed it on record that, upon Butler&rsquo;s
arrival at Fort Washington, &ldquo;he was soured
and disgusted, and I suppose it was occasioned
by the fault that had been found
with the detention of the Troops up the
river;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Knox&rsquo;s rebuke, previously
quoted, would make plain the reason of any
disinterest on the part of General Butler.
St. Clair&rsquo;s reproof here and now seemed to
increase it; &ldquo;from that moment,&rdquo; St. Clair
said, &ldquo;his coolness and distance increased,
and he seldom came near me. I was concerned
at it, but as I had given no cause, I
could apply no cure.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> As the half
mutinous, because half fed, army blundered
on, it might seem that lack of provisions
was its most serious menace; yet it becomes
pretty clear that the estrangement of Butler
and St. Clair was even more serious.</p>

<p>On the ninth of October, the army pushed
on nine miles, and the horses being tied up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
at night an eight o&rsquo;clock start was achieved
on the morning of the tenth, but only eight
miles were traversed. At two o&rsquo;clock on
the afternoon of the eleventh the army drew
out into the low prairie land which lies six
miles south of Fort Jefferson, Darke County,
Ohio, and halted for the night to search
for a safe path through it. On the day
after, a party led by General Butler found
a &ldquo;deep-beaten&rdquo; Indian trail which skirted
the lower levels &ldquo;avoiding the wet land,&rdquo;
and this was followed for five and a half
miles. There is no record that St. Clair
followed an Indian trail until near the center
of Darke County. The course heretofore
had been run by the compass.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>From this night&rsquo;s encampment St. Clair
rode forward a short mile and chose the
site for the next fort on the line from the
Ohio River to the Maumee. The spot
chosen was near the present site of Fort
Jefferson, Ohio&mdash;latitude 50&deg; 4&acute; 22&acute;&acute; N.
The work of erecting the new post was
undertaken with alacrity by many of the
soldiers and officers&mdash;the latter working in
the mud with the men. Major Ferguson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
found the lack of axes a serious handicap,
there being but one ax to three workmen.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
Yet these discouragements were not as disheartening
as the continual dearth of
provisions. This undermined discipline,
perseverance, loyalty, and honor. Desertions
became more alarmingly frequent,
but men who were not fed could not work
and would not march. As half-rations, and
those exceedingly poor, became the necessary
order of the day, the army slowly
melted from under the discouraged St.
Clair. Every night found the army smaller
and yet more discouraged.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> In vain St.
Clair beseeched Hodgdon to hurry on provisions.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
But the contractor&rsquo;s horses were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
lacking and those to be had were unfit for
the heavy loads bound to them.</p>

<p>And here at Fort Jefferson another and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
more pitiful estrangement between St.
Clair and Butler occurred. While the fort
was being erected, the latter officer came to
St. Clair&rsquo;s tent and, in view of the slow
advance of the army and the lateness of the
season, asked St. Clair for a thousand
picked men with permission to hurry on by
a forced march to the Maumee and begin
the erection of the fort there to be built.
&ldquo;I received the proposal,&rdquo; records St. Clair,
&ldquo;with an astonishment that, I doubt not,
was depicted in my countenance, and, in
truth, had liked to have laughed in his face,
which he probably discovered. I composed
my features, however, as well as I could,
told him, though it did not appear to me,
at first view, as a feasible project, nevertheless,
it deserved to be considered; that
I would consider it attentively, and give
him an answer in the morning, which I
accordingly did, with great gravity: and
from that moment, his distance and reserve
increased still more sensibly.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Butler
seems to have considered himself treated
with contempt in this instance. It cannot
be supposed that such a brave veteran<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
officer as Butler could have asked a thing
which it was out of St. Clair&rsquo;s power to
grant; yet from the records of the condition
of affairs it is difficult to see how St. Clair
could have risked dividing his army which,
for the whole week following, was on half-rations,
and men deserting by twos and
threes and even scores every night. Passing
the question&mdash;which in no way can be
decided&mdash;of the propriety of Butler&rsquo;s plan,
the circumstance seems to have deeply embittered
a brave and good man with whom
Fate had been dealing most unkindly since
the very beginning of the present campaign.
As will be seen, it were a kindness
to Butler to believe that continued untoward
fortune rendered him mentally incapable
of acting henceforward in a sane
manner toward General St. Clair.</p>

<p>Explorations were carried on throughout
the twenty-third and the line of march on
the Indian trail, previously discovered, was
renewed on the twenty-fourth; the army
stumbled helplessly on to Greenville Creek,
where the city of Greenville, Ohio, now
stands. This small effort to advance was
more than the hungry army could endure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and one whole dark week was spent here
waiting for provisions. The condition of
army discipline was probably indescribable.
The Kentuckians, who formed the large
portion of the militia, were not afraid of
the savages but the lack of food completely
demoralized them. On the last day of
October a large party numbering at least
sixty deserted, and, hastening down the
roadway which the army had cut, threatened
to seize the provision train that was
supposed to be slowly nearing the sorry
army. The threat cast a gloom over the
army and St. Clair was compelled to order
out the First Regiment, not so much in
pursuit of the deserters,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> as for the protection
of the needed provisions. The army,
weakened by the absence of this regiment,
marched on&mdash;following an Indian trail that
ran north from Greenville on the general
alignment of the present Fort Recovery
Road. St. Clair states the direction of the
path as &ldquo;north 25&deg; west.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Added to St. Clair&rsquo;s many discourage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>ments
and Butler&rsquo;s disaffection, was physical
ailment. The touch of gout experienced
on the journey over the Alleghenies did
not leave him. In his meager <i>Journal</i> he
records on October 24: &ldquo;So ill this day
that I had much difficulty in keeping with
the army.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> November dawned wet and
cold but on the first his &ldquo;friendly fit of
gout&rdquo; was growing better.</p>

<p>On the third of November the army made
its last day&rsquo;s march&mdash;little dreaming that
it was the last or that just ahead lay the
bloodiest battlefield in American pioneer
history. The Thomas Irwin manuscript,
previously quoted,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> gives us a glimpse of
the day that is of singularly pathetic interest.
&ldquo;In the afternoon of the 3<sup>d</sup> Something
Broke which Caused a general halt Nearly
one hour the Day was Cold us waggoners
in front had a very handy way of making
fire we made up a Large fire Several of the
officers Collected around to warm themselves
Gen<sup>l</sup> St Clair was Brought and took
a Seat he not Being able to walk they Discoursed
on Different Subjects one was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
where they thought we were the general
oppinion was that we had passed over the
Dividing ridge Between the Miamie waters
and was then on the waters of St. Marys
Col Serjant Came up at the time Stated the
advance gard had Chased 4 or 5 Indians
from a fire out of a thicket &amp; got part of a
venison at it he Likewise stated there had
Been more Indians Seen that Day than any
Day previous The General observed that
he Did not think the Indians was watching
the motions of the army with a view to
attack them other than Steal horses or
Catch a person if they had a Chance We
all Coincided [?] in that oppinion.&rdquo; Poor
St. Clair! Was ever a general more terribly
mistaken? Just beyond lay Little
Turtle, now closing swiftly in on the
doomed army.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The army moved about two miles,&rdquo;
continues Irwin, &ldquo;from there Halted to
Encamp at a good place But Scarce of Water
an Express Came up from the advance gard
give information that they had arrived at
a fine running Stream of water and a good
place to Encamp the army moved to S<sup>d</sup>

was Between 8 &amp; 9 oclock Before the army
got fixed to Rest.&rdquo; Then follows the
ominous sentence: &ldquo;this was on the 3<sup>d</sup> of
November 1791.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Happy it is that the bloody promontory
to which St. Clair&rsquo;s army hobbled late on
that cold November night can forever bear
the cheerful name which another and more
successful campaigner&mdash;whose soldiers
were not always half-famished&mdash;gave it.
And still no thoughtful student can look
upon the slow-moving Little Wabash from
the present site of Fort Recovery, Ohio,
without remembering that here Camp Destruction
was pitched before ever Fort
Recovery was erected. A fine high plateau
or promontory thrusts itself out into the
lower flats through which the river curves.
At its extreme point the river approaches
on the left and in front. On the right are
extensive fields where the sunlight plays
so tenderly that it is difficult to picture
the rank swamp which lay there a century
ago. Beyond the river, level flats extend
half a mile and more to the foothills
beyond.</p>

<p>Major Denny had accompanied the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
advance guard and quartermaster to this
spot, and though &ldquo;it was farther than could
have been wished,&rdquo; word was sent back to
the army advising that the march be continued
to that point. It being &ldquo;later than
usual when the army reached the ground
this evening,&rdquo; records Denny, &ldquo;and the
men much fatigued prevented the General
from having some works of defense immediately
erected.&rdquo; The army camped in a
hollow square on the summit of the promontory;
General Butler commanded the
right and front and his troops under Majors
Butler, Clarke, and Patterson lay in two
lines along the edge of the high ground
near the Wabash. The left was composed
of the battalions under Bedinger and Gaither,
in the first line, and Lieutenant-colonel
Darke&rsquo;s troops in the second. &ldquo;The army
was Encamped in a hollow Square,&rdquo; says
Irwin, &ldquo;allong the Bank of s<sup>d</sup> Creek perhaps
50 yards Between the Lines so that the rear
Could go to the Creek for water.&rdquo; The
militia was sent forward across the Wabash
and encamped about one-fourth of a mile
in the bottoms. The tired men fell to
work gathering wood, and soon two rows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
of fires were brightly blazing in the narrow
avenue between the troops of Butler on the
left and Darke on the right. The rain had
turned to snow. Many of the exhausted
men sank instantly to sleep.</p>

<p>As if half conscious of the doom hanging
over the army, certain of the officers were
given to pondering on the number of
Indians seen that day. &ldquo;Fresh signs,&rdquo;
writes Denny, &ldquo;... appeared today in
several places; parties of riflemen detached
after them, but without success.&rdquo; The
Irwin MS. reads: &ldquo;The advance gard Seen
they Supposed about 30 Indians in the Bottom
on the other Side of s<sup>d</sup> Creek [Wabash]
when they arrived at it in the Evening and
had Seen Considerable Sign that Day.&rdquo;
The premonition of disaster intensified as
the camp became quiet and the blazing fires
were brightly reflected in the light snow.
Among certain officers the premonition took
shape, and it was determined to send out a
party to reconnoiter. Captain Butler at
first resolved to lead the party, but soon
thought it improper to leave the camp.
Accordingly, Colonel Gibson went to Captain
Slough of the first battalion of levies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
carrying a raccoon in his hand; finding
Slough, he invited him to his tent to see
&ldquo;how to dress a racoon Indian fashion.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
Captain Butler joined them, and the three
went to General Butler&rsquo;s tent where wine
was served. Slough agreed to go out with
a party of volunteers, nominally to catch
&ldquo;some of the rascals who might attempt to
steal horses.&rdquo; It is plain, whatever the
officers may have given as a reason for the
scouting expedition, that Slough was sent
to feel of the woods&mdash;to guard against
surprise. His line of men paraded in the
firelight before Butler&rsquo;s tent before stealing
out beyond the lines. Passing Colonel
Oldham&rsquo;s tent, Slough stopped and informed
that officer of the detachment and
its mission. Colonel Oldham &ldquo;was lying
down with his clothes on&rdquo; and &ldquo;requested
me not to go, as he was sure my party
would be cut off, for, says he, I expect the
army will be attacked in the morning; I
replied, that as I had received my orders I
must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slough led his party through the militia
camp and onward about a mile on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Indian trail. Here they were divided, each
party hiding on opposite sides of the path.
Soon a party of Indians passed each hiding
company; one company opened fire. It was
not long before the men realized that something
extraordinary was on hand. A larger
body of Indians soon came near Slough&rsquo;s
band on the left of the trace, paused, and
coughed as if to attract another volley, and
then passed on. The scouting party came
together on the trail and agreed that an
Indian army was advancing; a hurried
march to camp followed. On the way
&ldquo;every fifteen or twenty yards we heard
something moving in the woods on both
sides of the path, but could not see what it
was,&rdquo; wrote Slough. It was a thrilling
moment when these men heard Little
Turtle&rsquo;s quiet lines worming their way
through the underbrush&mdash;an army making
so strange a noise in the night that even
frontiersmen could not recognize it. Yet
an unrecognized sound brought utmost
alarm; &ldquo;we pushed on,&rdquo; said Slough, &ldquo;and
gained the militia camp as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slough&rsquo;s first thought was to send word<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
immediately to St. Clair. He hurried to
Colonel Oldham&rsquo;s tent. &ldquo;I was just going
to dress myself,&rdquo; says Oldham, &ldquo;and go
and inform the commander in chief about
it; I will thank you [Slough] to inform the
general that I think the army will be
attacked in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slough hastened to General Butler&rsquo;s tent,
but, seeing no one but the sentry, passed
on to Colonel Gibson&rsquo;s tent. Here he
aroused Gibson and Doctor M&rsquo;Croskey, and
repeated his alarming story. He asked
Gibson to go with him to General Butler.
Colonel Gibson was not dressed, and urged
Slough to go alone and arouse Butler. He
obeyed, and as he returned to General Butler&rsquo;s
tent the latter walked out of it and
went to the fire. Calling Butler aside, that
the sentry should not overhear the news,
&ldquo;I told him what colonel Oldham had said,
and that, if he thought proper, I would go
and make the report to general St. Clair.
He stood some time, and after a pause,
thanked me for my attention and vigilance,
and said, as I must be fatigued I had better
go and lie down. I went from him and
lay down....&rdquo; It was five days before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
General St. Clair heard of Slough&rsquo;s scouting
episode of the night of November 3.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>All that Slough and Oldham suspected
was true and more. All night long the
Indians crept around the army, ready for
an attack at sunrise. The army began
stirring at an early hour; some there were,
it is sure, who anxiously awaited the dawn.
The troops paraded under arms, as usual,
before sunrise. Ranks had just been broken
when a scattering fire was heard in the
militia camp, and soon the Indian yell.
The militia stood a moment and then fell
back to the river, crossed it, and were upon
Major Butler&rsquo;s and Clark&rsquo;s battalions,
throwing the latter into a confusion that
was never remedied despite the energy of
those officers. The Indians were upon the
heels of the militia, but were repulsed by
the fire of the first line. With well-timed
accuracy the Indians charged the opposite
side of the square, where, too, they were
at first repulsed. The American army was
now practically surrounded&mdash;the savages
lying hidden in the brush, forests, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
high grass on the low ground which surrounded
the promontory on three sides and
in front. The artillery was placed at the
center of the two sides of the square and
here the battle raged most fiercely. For
some time, it would seem, the honors of the
conflict were evenly divided. But from the
position of the two armies it can readily be
seen that the American fire was not so
effective as that of the savages whose firmness
and audacity was unparalleled. From
their concealed position it required little
marksmanship to pick men off rapidly on
the high ground just beyond and hidden
only by a low-lying cloud of smoke from
their own guns. The officers, hurrying
back and forth, offered conspicuous targets.
From St. Clair (who had to be assisted to
mount his horse) down, the officers were
brave and efficient. As St. Clair passed
down one line, Butler passed up the other.
They never met, though St. Clair frequently
asked for Butler as the battle wore away.</p>

<p>At last it was agreed that things were
going badly and that a bayonet charge,
only, would dislodge the enemy, who were
rapidly cutting down the efficient strength<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
of the army&mdash;making particular havoc
among the officers. Colonel Darke was
thereupon ordered to turn the left flank of
the enemy, which he accomplished with
firmness and success&mdash;driving the savages
several hundred yards. Yet soon they
swarmed back, not being held where they
were, and, in turn drove the troops backward.
About the cannon, which the
Indians were taught to dread, the battle
ebbed and flowed bloodily. As fast as the
gunners were shot down others took their
places. Now and again the red line swept
up to the guns and the piles of slain were
scalped, amid the smoke, in the very face
of the army. On the left flank, too, the
savages were beginning to overpower and
gain the summit of the promontory and
enter the lines. They were charged fiercely
but after each charge there was a sudden
dearth of officers, and the lines returned
very thin. The army was now attacked
from every side, though not until late in
the long three hours of conflict did the
Indians take the initiative. Their settled
plan was to get the troops in range, lie low,
make no noise save with their guns, retire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
when assaulted, but follow back eagerly.
Such tactics were all that were necessary.
As in Braddock&rsquo;s battle beside the Monongahela,
so here, the white army on higher
ground in plain sight could not do such
fatal execution, by any means, as the Indian
army strewn among the standing and fallen
trees, the brush and rank grasses of the
lower ground, and on the sloping sides of
the promontory.</p>

<p>By nine o&rsquo;clock the army had been
exposed for three hours to the merciless
Indian fire. Hundreds had fallen; the
ground was literally covered with dead and
dying. The only question was, Could the
remainder escape? The army was cut off
from the road. Benjamin Van Cleve, a
young man, has left record of this memorable
break for the road when order to
retreat was at last given: &ldquo;I found,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;the troops pressing like a drove of
bullocks to the right. I saw an officer ... with
six or eight men start on a run a little
to the left of where I was. I immediately
ran and fell in with them. In a short distance
we were so suddenly among the
Indians, who were not apprised of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
object, that they opened to us and ran to
the right and left without firing. I think
about two hundred of our men passed
through them before they fired.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> An
opening being made, the army poured
heedlessly along. No order or semblance of
order existed, save in a remnant of Clark&rsquo;s
command which essayed to cover the rear.
In the very rear, on a horse which could
not be pricked out of a walk, came St. Clair,
unmindful of the bloody tumult behind him
where the old men and wounded were
being killed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This awful battle was a fitting close for
such a campaign. In almost every sense
it was the greatest defeat suffered by white
men on this continent at the hands of
aborigines. St. Clair&rsquo;s army numbered on
the eve of November 3 one thousand four
hundred and eighty-six men and eighty-six
officers. Of these, eight hundred and ninety
men and sixteen officers were killed or
wounded. The army poured back to Fort
Jefferson and then on to Fort Washington.
The path hewn northward became, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Braddock&rsquo;s Road, a route for the hordes of
Indians toward the frontiers. Their victory,
so bloody, so overwhelming, gave
confidence. Perhaps never before nor afterward
did any battlefield present a scene
equal to that Wabash slaughter field. The
dying were tortured and the dead frightfully
mutilated. On the theory that the
army sought to conquer the Indian land,
sand was crushed into the eyes of the dead
in cruel mockery. Several scores of women
followed the army&mdash;though contemporary
records are singularly silent on this point.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
Many of them, it is sure, fell into the hands
of the savages and the first white visitors
to the battleground found great stakes
driven through many corpses.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>The two underlying causes for this terrible
reverse of American arms were the
long delay in getting the army on its feet,
properly supplied; and the undisciplined
condition of the troops. The immediate
cause of the defeat was, without question,
the failure of all the officers who knew of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Captain Slough&rsquo;s discoveries on the night
of November 3 to communicate them to
General St. Clair. Colonel Oldham ordered
Slough to St. Clair; he went only to General
Butler who dismissed him without
acceding to his spoken request to be allowed
to take the news to the commander-in-chief.
The words of the standard authority on St.
Clair&rsquo;s defeat are perhaps severe, but no
new information has come in half a century
to give ground for altering them; Albach
says: &ldquo;The circumstances under which the
omission occurred, would favor an inference
that he [Butler] sacrificed the safety of the
army to the gratification of his animosity
against St. Clair. The evidence given
before the committee of Congress is conclusive
that he failed, at least to perform
his whole duty in the premises.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Butler&rsquo;s
side of the story could never be told; fatally
wounded while heroically exhorting his
men, the poor man was carried to his marquee
under an oak, by his brother, Captain
Edward Butler. Propped up on his mattress,
a loaded revolver placed in each
hand, the old veteran was left to his fate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
As his friends left the tent by the rear, the
Indians surged in at the front.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>St. Clair&rsquo;s road northward was the main
thoroughfare to Fort Hamilton and Fort
Jefferson from the Ohio and, though superseded
by another route soon built parallel
to it, was ever of importance in the burst
of population from Pennsylvania and Kentucky
into the Old Northwest. But the
soldiers of St. Clair&rsquo;s successor were too
superstitious to follow that ill-starred track.
And, as Forbes came successfully to Fort
Duquesne over a new route built parallel
to Braddock&rsquo;s, so the second conqueror of
the Old Northwest cut a new road parallel
to St. Clair&rsquo;s.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>WAYNE AND FALLEN TIMBER</h3>


<p>The defeat of St. Clair&rsquo;s army cast a
nation into gloom. As the terrible
tidings sped eastward a thousand
frontier cabins were filled with dismayed
men, women, and children. The passion
into which it is said the patient Washington
was thrown, upon hearing the melancholy
story, was typical of the feeling of a whole
people. There could be no doubt, now,
what the future would bring forth; a deluge
of raiding savages, such as had never overrun
the frontiers since Braddock&rsquo;s defeat
in 1755, would certainly come; the desperate
cry, &ldquo;White men shall not plant corn
north of the Ohio,&rdquo; would now ring out
over the thin fringe of frightened settlements
on the Miami and Muskingum, and
with that cry would come frenzied raiders
from whose tomahawks men would do well
to escape death and women be fortunate if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
they were quickly killed. From all the
western settlements in Kentucky, Ohio,
and Pennsylvania a cry, anxious and
often piteous, was hurried over the
mountains to Philadelphia for aid and
protection.</p>

<p>The young government now faced a
problem difficult in the extreme with fine
courage, fully conscious of its own dignity
and its own latent power. Within six
weeks of St. Clair&rsquo;s annihilation, the Secretary
of War submitted a statement to
Congress which summed up the situation
briefly and clearly. The former treaties
with the Indians, the efforts for peace, the
sorry details of the campaign were all
described. Peaceful and warlike efforts,
alike, had failed. So much for the past.
For the future, the plan was already formulated
and ready for adoption by Congress.
First, the war must be brought to an end;
if peace could be secured without further
resort to arms, well and good; &ldquo;it is submitted,&rdquo;
read the Secretary&rsquo;s communication,
&ldquo;that every reasonable expedient be
again taken ... that the nature of the
case, and a just regard to the national<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
reputation, will admit.&rdquo; Those in best
position to judge, however, were sure that
the pride of victory was so strong among
the confederated nations that &ldquo;it would be
altogether improper to expect any favorable
result from such [peaceful] expedients,&rdquo;
and Congress was warned accordingly that
it was &ldquo;by an ample conviction of superior
force only, that the Indians can be brought
to listen to the dictates of peace on reasonable
terms.&rdquo; It was properly insisted that
relinquishment of territory formerly ceded
by the savages could not be arranged &ldquo;consistently
with a proper regard to national
reputation.&rdquo; The plan included the
organization of a new army, comprising
three hundred cavalry, three hundred artillerymen,
and five regiments of infantry of
four thousand five hundred and sixty men.
It was to be styled &ldquo;The Legion of the
United States,&rdquo; and was to be divided into
four sub-legions of one thousand two hundred
and eighty non-commissioned officers
and privates each. The mistakes of the
past dictated the necessity of having this
force disciplined &ldquo;according to the nature
of the service;&rdquo; its ultimate object was to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
establish a strong post on the present site
of Fort Wayne, Indiana.</p>

<p>To secure a comprehensive grasp of the
interesting campaign now undertaken, it is
necessary to keep in mind simultaneously
three situations: this new army, the moving
companies of peace commissioners, and
that ragged pathway northward from Fort
Washington with the little stockade forts
which guarded it. These varying phases
will be treated chronologically, at the risk
of coherency, and the scattered threads
gathered much in the tangled order in
which they were spun amid many hopes
and many fears.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the first important matters, in
this as in previous campaigns, was to retain
the neutrality of the Six Nations. The
efforts in the year preceding had been
approximately successful, though, according
to his biographer, Stone, Joseph Brant
with a party of Mohawks was present at St.
Clair&rsquo;s defeat. As early as January 9,
1792, an express was hurried off to the
Reverend Samuel Kirtland, veteran missionary
among the Iroquois, informing him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
that Colonel Pickering had invited the
principal chiefs of the Six Nations to visit
Washington. He was urged to assist in
securing their acquiescence, especially
Joseph Brant&rsquo;s, and to accompany them on
the journey.</p>

<p>The next act of Secretary Knox is peculiarly
significant and interesting. Captain
Peter Pond, a trader, and one William
Steedman were ordered to proceed westward
to the hostile tribes on the Maumee,
feigning to be traders. &ldquo;No doubt can
exist,&rdquo; wrote Knox, &ldquo;that our strength and
our resources are abundant to conquer, and
even extirpate the Indians.... But this
is not our object. We wish to be at peace
with those Indians&mdash;to be their friends
and protectors&mdash;to perpetuate them on the
land. The desire, therefore, that we have
for peace, must not be inconsistent with the
national reputation. We cannot ask the
Indians to make peace with us, considering
them as the aggressors: but they must ask
a peace of us. To persuade them to this
effect is the object of your mission. Insinuate,
upon all favorable occasions, the
humane disposition of the United States;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and, if you can by any means ripen their
judgement, so as to break forth openly [disclose
yourselves], and declare the readiness
of the United States to receive, with open
arms, the Indians, ... do it.... You
might persuade some of the most influential
chiefs to repair to our posts on the Ohio,
and so, from post to post, to this place.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
Perhaps never in warfare were spies sent
amongst an enemy on so remarkable a
mission.</p>

<p>In response to the Government&rsquo;s invitation,
fifty Indian chieftains from the Six
Nations arrived in Philadelphia on March
13. They were treated with utmost courtesy
by the government officials and proper
gifts distributed. Among other benefits,
fifteen hundred dollars a year was promised
by the United States to be spent encouraging
education and agriculture in the Iroquois
land. The chief boon secured by this
display of hospitality and liberality was the
promise that the Six Nations would wholly
abstain from war and would immediately
send a delegation to the western tribes to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
mediate between them and the United
States, secure an armistice, and make plans
for a final treaty of peace. In this promise
the Government placed great hope. The
Six Nations were the most prominent of
their race on the continent and their chieftains
exerted an influence equaled by none.
Having received, in person, from the
nation&rsquo;s highest executive officers, protestations
of friendliest nature, they were the
best emissaries that could possibly treat
with the hostile tribes on the Maumee on
behalf of the Government.</p>

<p>Yet efforts to avert war did not stop here.
By May it was determined to send an envoy
extraordinary to the Maumee, if the hazard
could possibly be accomplished. The Iroquois
chiefs would, it was believed, keep
their solemn pledges, yet affairs of such
a nature usually developed very slowly
among red-men and in the present crisis
there was no time to be lost. Accordingly
a fitting personage was chosen by President
Washington to make the perilous
attempt. His choice fell quickly on the
brave leader of the Ohio Company pioneers
to Marietta&mdash;General Rufus Putnam.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Sufficient provision for his family in case of
a disastrous termination of his journey
being promised by the Government, the
quiet, bold pioneer departed from his frontier
home on May 22 for Fort Washington.
His instructions were explicit. He was
first to assure the hostile nations that the
United States did not in the least desire
any of the Indian&rsquo;s land, but rather solemnly
pledged itself to &ldquo;guaranty all that remain,
and take the Indians under our protection.&rdquo;
In turn the Indians were to agree to a truce
and call in all war-parties. The most
prominent chiefs were to be invited to
Philadelphia to make a treaty; on his way
westward General Putnam was empowered
to release all Indian prisoners retained at
Fort Washington and give the women presents
to carry home with them in token of
the Government&rsquo;s pacific intentions.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The frontier to which Putnam now came
was in need of brave men and strong.
These had been long months since that
dark November day when the remains of
St. Clair&rsquo;s shattered army poured back upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Fort Jefferson and Fort Hamilton, Brigadier-general
Wilkinson now commanded at
Fort Washington and with a firm hand was
managing affairs on the firing-line. His
outposts, Forts Hamilton and Jefferson,
were frequently surrounded by Indian
scouts sent down the narrow trace from
Little Turtle&rsquo;s cantonments on the Maumee,
but no attack on these posts had yet
been made in force. Such an attack was
frequently anticipated, and many sudden
calls to arms sounded now and again within
the little garrisons lost so far within the
northern forests. The brave Captain John
Armstrong still commanded at Fort Hamilton,
guarding the strategic ford of the
Great Miami and the narrow roadway
toward Fort Jefferson and the silent corpse-strewn
battle-ground beyond. Wilkinson&rsquo;s
principal duty was to keep the garrisons of
his three little forts alive and in heart, and
keep a watchful eye on the victorious
enemy. In January, calling on volunteers
from the country about Cincinnati, Wilkinson
organized a little company to visit St.
Clair&rsquo;s slaughter-ground. The snow was
two feet deep&mdash;a depth seldom if ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
exceeded in southwestern Ohio. Kentucky
volunteers crossed the Ohio on ice above
the mouth of the Little Miami. Leaving
Fort Washington January 25, the fatal field
was reached February 1. Such was the
depth of snow that comparatively few
bodies could be found, save as here and
there, on knolls and ridges, a white mound
of driven snow marked where a wolf had
left a scalped and mangled corpse. The
winter of 1791-92 likewise witnessed the
erection of an intermediary post between
Forts Hamilton and Jefferson, most appropriately
named Fort St. Clair. It was
erected by a body of men under command
of Captain John S. Gano, under whom
William Henry Harrison served, half a
mile west of the present site of Eaton,
Preble County, at St. Clair&rsquo;s Crossing of
&ldquo;Garrison Branch&rdquo; of Seven Mile Creek.</p>

<p>As the spring of 1792 opened, and the
forest roads became passable, it was expected
that the Indians, by a concerted
movement, would attempt to sweep the
three forts north of the Ohio and make
good their unjust claim to possession of that
northern shore.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly spies were kept well out on
the trails for any sign of an advancing
army. Others were sent nearer the Indian&rsquo;s
lair. On April 7 two messengers, Freeman
and Gerrard, were sent from Fort Washington
with a speech to the hostile tribes, being
ordered to follow Harmar&rsquo;s Trace up the
Little and Great Miamis. Three days
later Wilkinson sent word to Armstrong to
order out a spy by way of St. Clair&rsquo;s road,
who should carefully study the route all
the way to the Miami towns. Accordingly
one of the boldest men on the frontier,
William May, was ordered to &ldquo;desert&rdquo; to
the enemy and, shaving his head and adopting
their dress and manner of living, to
learn all that was being planned and done
in the red-men&rsquo;s camps. On May 12 Sergeant
Reuben Reynolds was ordered to
&ldquo;desert&rdquo; from Fort St. Clair and also follow
St. Clair&rsquo;s route to the Maumee and
reside with the Indians until a favorable
opportunity to return occurred. On May
20 Colonel Hardin and Captain Alexander
Trueman left Fort Washington for the
Maumee, bearing an official message from
the Government, of similar tenor to that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
given to General Putnam. Thus six men
had preceded Putnam to the Maumee, and
only two of them went merely as spies&mdash;May
and Reynolds. The fate of four of
these men dampened the ardor of the frontier
people for peaceful efforts. Freeman,
Gerrard, Trueman, and Hardin were all
murdered before reaching the Maumee.
Reynolds and May returned in safety later
in the year.</p>

<p>General Putnam learned at Fort Washington
of the fate of his predecessors and
determined not to throw life away uselessly.
Favorable messages having been received
from the upper Wabash, he turned all his
efforts toward securing a meeting with the
Wabash Indians in the fall of the year at
Vincennes, Indiana. No more attempts
were made to reach the Maumee over the
&ldquo;Bloody Way,&rdquo; as the Indians termed the
route north from Fort Washington. &ldquo;The
President of the United States must know
well why the blood is so deep in our
paths,&rdquo; exclaimed a Shawanese chieftain,
&ldquo;... he has sent messengers of peace
on these bloody roads, who fell on the
way.&rdquo; A messenger was even now pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>paring
to come this way to whom bloody
roads were not new and for whom they had
no fear. Leaving the Indian commissioners
going slowly on their way to a conference
with the hostile tribes at &ldquo;Auglaize&rdquo;&mdash;the
mouth of the Auglaize River where
Defiance, Ohio, now stands&mdash;and Putnam
waiting for the Weas and Kickapoos to
assemble at Vincennes, let us look back to
the gathering &ldquo;Legion of the United
States&rdquo; into whose ready hands the matter
of peace would go when the Indians got
courage enough to throw off the mask.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was one thing to plan an army on
paper but a far more serious task to raise
and organize it. And first and foremost
arose the trebly difficult task of choosing a
leader. The officers of Revolutionary days
were fast passing into old age, and as
Washington looked about him to the comrades
of former years, there were few left
capable of taking up the difficult task that
St. Clair laid down. A memorandum left
by Washington indicates the serious necessity
of a wise choice and the nature of the
possible candidates. Lincoln was sober,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
honest, and brave, but infirm and past the
vigor of life; Baron Steuben, a stickler for
tactics, was likewise sober and brave and
sensible, but a foreigner; Moultrie was
brave and had fought against the Cherokees,
but Washington knew little of him; McIntosh
was considered honest and brave but
was not well known and consequently not
popular, and was infirm; Wayne was &ldquo;More
active and enterprising than Judicious and
cautious. No &#339;conomist it is feared:&mdash;open
to flattery&mdash;vain&mdash;easily imposed
upon and liable to be drawn into scrapes.
Too indulgent (the effect perhaps of some
of the causes just mentioned) to his Officers.
Whether sober&mdash;or a little addicted to the
bottle I know not;&rdquo; Weedon was not deficient
of resource and was of a convivial
nature though not unduly so; Hand was
sensible and judicious and not intemperate;
Scott was brave and &ldquo;means well&rdquo; but
not suited for extensive command, convivial;
Huntington, sober, sensible, discreet;
Wilkinson, lively, sensible, pompous, and
ambitious, &ldquo;whether sober or not I do not
know;&rdquo; Gist, activity and attention doubtful,
but of noble spirit; Irvine, sober,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
tolerably sensible, prudent, an &ldquo;&#339;conomist;&rdquo;
Morgan, fortunate and had met with
<i>&eacute;clat</i>, possibly intemperate, troubled with
palpitation and illiterate; Williams sensible
though vain, in poor health; Putnam,
(Rufus) strong-minded, discreet, &ldquo;nothing
conspicuous in character ... known
little out of his own State and a narrow
circle;&rdquo; Pinckney, brave, honorable, erudite,
sensible and a stickler for tactics.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>No other officers are named as possible
candidates for a position no one could possibly
desire. As the list stands, it forms a
startling refutation of the oft repeated saying
that though drinking was common in
the old days it was not carried to excess.
The problem with Washington seems to
have been, speaking mildly, to find a
responsible man with a clear head. His
decision at first seems to have wavered
between Lincoln and Moultrie; under these
men as major-generals, Wayne, Morgan,
and Wilkinson might serve as brigadiers.
What may have induced the final decision<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
cannot be stated definitely, but the command
was at last offered to Brevet Major-general
&ldquo;Mad&rdquo; Anthony Wayne and it
was accepted. Brevet Brigadier-generals
Wilkinson and Thomas Posey were second
in active command. Major-general Scott
was to command fifteen hundred mounted
Kentucky militia.</p>

<p>As with Washington, so with Wayne, the
most serious task was to choose his officers
from the recruits which early in 1792 were
hurried on to Pittsburg to defend the frontier
under the dashing hero of Stony Point&mdash;Wayne&rsquo;s
appointment having been well
received everywhere save in Virginia and
Kentucky. If the army was to be disciplined
&ldquo;according to the nature of the
service&rdquo;&mdash;Indian-fighting&mdash;Indian-fighters
must do the training. &ldquo;We will be
under the necessity,&rdquo; wrote Wayne to Knox
from Pittsburg, &ldquo;of discharging many of
the men&mdash;who never were&mdash;nor never
will be fit for service, they are at present a
nuisance to the Legion &amp; a useless expense
to the publick.... You may rest assured
I will carefully guard against improper
appointments or recommendations&mdash;we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
shall have some difficulty before we can
purge the Legion of Characters who never
were fit for Officers.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Such administrative
ability as this was the very thing
needed on the frontier; it drove from the
gathering army many useless characters
and made possible the encouragement and
promotion of such valuable men as Lieutenant
William Clark (of Lewis and Clark
fame), Eaton, and William Henry Harrison.
The fine spirit of Wayne infused courage
throughout the frontier and made men
eager to serve and win promotion, though
sometimes &ldquo;without shoez or shirts called
upon to do the hardest duty &amp; 7 mo. pay
due&mdash;while they have not money to buy a
chew of tobacco.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>One of the most interesting manuscripts
now extant of Wayne, his army, its marches
and battles, is preserved in the library of
the State Historical Society of Wisconsin.
Its author was no less a personage than
Brigadier-general Thomas Posey, associated
with General Wilkinson as second in com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>mand
of the army. General Posey&rsquo;s journal
continually emphasizes the human
element in the scenes through which he
passed, and frequent side-lights from this
hitherto unused source will be introduced
in this narrative.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Posey reached Pittsburg
on August 2. &ldquo;As we passed through
the upper part of Virginia,&rdquo; he leaves record
of the journey across the mountains,
&ldquo;the people would often say what a pitty,
such a likely parcel of young men were
Going to be Slaughtered by the indians as
Gen<sup>l</sup> St Clair&rsquo;s army was.&rdquo; One of the
most striking observations of Pittsburg was
the ominous statement, &ldquo;at least one half
of the People of Pittsburg are in mourning
for Gen<sup>l</sup> Richard Butler.&rdquo; Throughout
the summer the gathering troops remained
at Pittsburg while rigid examinations and
drilling exercises were begun. On November
28 the army moved down the Ohio to a
distance of seven miles above Fort McIntosh
at the mouth of Beaver Creek and twenty-two
miles below Pittsburg; this place was
accordingly named Legionville. Here,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
&ldquo;out of the reach of whisky, which baneful
poison is prohibited from entering this
camp,&rdquo; as Wayne wrote the Secretary of
War,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> winter quarters were established,
houses for the soldiers being erected first
and those for officers afterward. Severe
daily drilling was the order of the day at
Legionville, the result of which, though
delayed, was sure.</p>

<p>While Wayne was whipping an army into
shape on the upper Ohio two events were
on the tapis at opposite corners of the Black
Forest of the West to which the officials at
Philadelphia were paying much heed. At
Vincennes, on the twentieth of September,
Putnam was scheduled to meet the delegates
of the Wabash Nations for a treaty of peace,
and early in October the commissioners
from the Six Nations were to meet the
chiefs of the disaffected northwestern tribes
at the mouth of the Auglaize on the broad
Maumee. At Vincennes Putnam accomplished
all that could have been expected,
and a treaty was signed by thirty-one Wabash
chiefs on September 27. The treaty,
finally, was not ratified by the United<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
States Senate because of an objectionable
clause which was not compatible with the
law of eminent domain.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Where Defiance, Ohio, now stands, flanked
by its two rivers, one of the most unique
conventions in our history assembled as the
autumn winds stirred the forests. From
the east, Cornplanter and a stately retinue
of forty-eight chiefs of the Six Nations
proceeded to &ldquo;Au Glaize.&rdquo; From even
the far-away Canadian Nations emissaries
arrived. When at last the famous convention
assembled, and the pipe passed from
chieftain to chieftain, two speakers, only,
addressed the assembly. Red Jacket spoke
for the Senecas and the delegation from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Iroquois land. A Shawanese chieftain,
whose name was not recorded, answered on
the part of the hostile tribes. His words
were a bold rebuke to the Six Nations for
maintaining friendship with the United
States. &ldquo;... although you consider us
your younger brothers,&rdquo; sneered the Shawanese,
&ldquo;your seats are not at such a
distance, but what we can see your conduct
plainly; these are the reasons why we consider
you to speak from the outside of your
lips; for whenever you hear the voice of
the United States, you immediately take
your packs and attend their councils....
We see plainly folded under your arm the
voice of the United States&mdash;wish you to
unfold it to us, that we may see it freely
and consult on it.&rdquo; So saying he threw a
triple string of wampum across the fire to
the Senecas rather than handing it across
in a friendly way. That Philadelphia conference
of last March did not please the
western tribes.</p>

<p>In turn the Seneca sketched the story of
the French and English domination and of
the birth of the United States, which, he
said, desired peace with the confederated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Indians. The Shawanese repeated the
story of St. Clair&rsquo;s disaster of the year
before and asserted that the Indians claimed
certain lands east of the Ohio and all lands
west of that river. Those to the eastward
would be given up for proper compensation.
In reply to the Seneca&rsquo;s desire to
bring about a treaty with the hostile nations,
the Shawanese replied: &ldquo;Inform General
Washington we will treat with him, at the
Rapids of Miami, next spring, or at the
time when the leaves are fully out....
We will lay the bloody tomahawk aside,
until we hear from the President of the
United States....&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Cornplanter returned
eastward with his delegation and
the reports of the convention were hurried
on to Philadelphia with the ominous hint
that no boundary would ever be consented
to by the northwestern Indians save only
the Ohio River. The message as it spread
across the Alleghenies brought dark days
and anxious nights to cabins on the thin
fringe of pioneer settlements from the
Muskingum to the Miami.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>As the winter winds came down from
the north, two of the spies sent out from
Fort Washington came in from the forests&mdash;May
from Niagara and Reynolds from
Montreal. Leaving Fort Hamilton, May
crossed St. Clair&rsquo;s battlefield; beyond, in
Harmar&rsquo;s trail, he found Trueman and two
other men killed and scalped; captured, he
was saved from death by Simon Girty and
sold to Matthew Elliott, in whose employ
he labored on the lakes. In numerous
instances he identified scalps of friends,
in particular that of Colonel Hardin. In
September Girty had gone on a raiding
expedition to &ldquo;Fallentimber&rdquo; between
Forts St. Clair and Hamilton to capture
horses, saying that he would &ldquo;do every
mischief in his power&rdquo; and &ldquo;raise hell to
prevent a peace.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Reuben Reynolds,
after varied experiences, came down from
Montreal through the Vermont forests to
Philadelphia, where his deposition was
taken by Washington&rsquo;s secretary, Lear,
October 19. The Lake Superior Indians
had joined the confederacy and &ldquo;they
expected to have three thousand or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
thousand five hundred Indians in the field
against the Americans.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> May, with
equally exaggerated reports, affirmed that
there were &ldquo;3,600 warriors&rdquo; at the Auglaize
River.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Not long after this Wayne
entertained at his camp at Legionville several
of the chiefs of the Allegheny, Cornplanter,
New Arrow, Big Tree, and
Guasutha. Pointing to the Ohio from
where he sat, one of them&mdash;according to
Posey&rsquo;s journal&mdash;said: &ldquo;My Heart &amp; mind
is fixed on that River &amp; may that water
Continue to run &amp; remain the boundary of
everlasting Peice, between the white &amp; Red
People on its opposite shores.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Few who had been watching the western
situation believed but that spring would
bring war. The Indians did not even keep
the promised truce. Major Adair, encamped
beside the &ldquo;Bloody Way&rdquo; within sight of
Fort St. Clair, was murderously attacked
by Indians early in the morning of November
6. Six whites were killed and
five wounded and a large number of packhorses
purloined. However few attacks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
such as this occurred along the frontier.
In March, President Washington appointed
the commissioners who were to treat with
the Indians at the rapids of the Maumee
&ldquo;when the leaves are fully out.&rdquo; Benjamin
Lincoln, Beverly Randolph, and
Timothy Pickering were appointed, and
received their commissions April 26. General
Lincoln left on the twenty-seventh
with the baggage for Niagara by way of
the Mohawk Valley; Pickering and Randolph
left Philadelphia by way of the Susquehanna
on April 30.</p>

<p>On the same day another delegation
departed from the upper Ohio for the West
but not altogether on a peaceful mission;
it was Wayne&rsquo;s army, disciplined, hardened,
and eager for the long-anticipated conflict.
To Wayne, war seemed inevitable; when
informed that the commissioners were to
be sent to the Maumee according to agreement,
he playfully expressed a desire to be
present &ldquo;with 2500 of his commissioners in
company, with not a single Quaker among
them!&rdquo; Before leaving Legionville he had
ordered a number of color flags for the
sub-legions of the Secretary of War saying,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
with the confidence of a man who could
not but win, &ldquo;they shall never be lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the third army of the United States
floated down the winding Ohio in April,
1793. No other army on the Ohio, since
the day Forbes&rsquo;s and Bouquet&rsquo;s British
regulars left Fort Pitt, could be compared
with it in discipline and trustworthiness.
Harmar&rsquo;s and St. Clair&rsquo;s armies were rabbles
beside it. Yet there had been a great
struggle to secure proper subordination of
officers and proper loyalty on the part of
the rank and file. Liberty meant license
on the frontier, and here lay Wayne&rsquo;s heaviest
task and greatest victory. With a
trained, sober army victory was a matter of
time only. However, the Government
still looked for a happy outcome of the
convention at the rapids of the Maumee;
and Wayne was strictly ordered to make no
hostile movement until the result of that
meeting was known. It was expected that,
by August 1, the question of war or peace
would have been decided. Wayne landed,
and encamped about a mile below Fort
Washington, where the high waters left
only one convenient spot, which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
accordingly dubbed &ldquo;Hobson&rsquo;s Choice.&rdquo;
The encampment extended to within four
hundred yards of the village of Cincinnati,
according to the Posey journal. From this
village and its stock &ldquo;of ardent spirit and
caitiff wretches to dispose of it&rdquo; Wayne
was anxious to be separated.</p>

<p>The summer passed slowly, and each
day&rsquo;s tidings from the north was awaited
with such patience as could be mustered.
Faithful drilling, interrupted by fevers and
influenza, was the order of the day, according
to General Posey&rsquo;s record. The
number of challenges and duels suggests
something of the social order. On one
occasion an officer challenged one of his
superiors who, in reply, had him arrested
to obviate an encounter. In June a premature
report came that the peace commissioners
had failed in their mission. &ldquo;We
now have but one alternative left,&rdquo; wrote
Posey, &ldquo;and this is We must meet the
Savage foe, The Emortal Washington at
the Head of our Government, and the Old
hero Gen<sup>l</sup> Wayne and His well disciplined
Legion, we have little to fear accept our
god and fear him in love.&rdquo; The summer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
wore on with little or no definite tidings
from the north. The troops were exercised
daily and the necessities of the possible
campaign were pushed on up the line of
forts from the Ohio River to Fort Jefferson.
Contractors and quartermasters were kept
busy supplying the comparatively large
army. The army and the nation waited
for word from the rapids of the Maumee.
What would that word be?</p>

<p>As the leaves began to open, the emissaries
of a hundred Indian nations were
threading the forests of the Old Northwest
and Canada upon trails converging on the
western shore of Lake Erie. Roche de
Bout,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> as the locality of the &ldquo;Rapids of
the Miami of the Lakes&rdquo; was known, was
on the present site of Maumee City, Ohio.
Great fields of Indian corn spread up and
down both sides of the broad valley; a score
of vegetable plants thrived amid the corn.
In the same area probably no such amount
of ground was under cultivation by Indian
squaws as in the Maumee Valley. The
spreading fields supported many villages
and it was from these important centers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Indian life that so many marauding parties
descended upon Kentucky, calling forth
retaliating armies such as those of Clark,
Harmar, and St. Clair. And Harmar, only,
had actually reached this populous and
fertile lair. Here the convention was to be
held. The United States commissioners
had proceeded to Niagara where they were
entertained generously by Governor Simcoe
at Navy Hall, a mile distant from Fort
Niagara, being advised that the delegates
from the various nations would undoubtedly
be late arriving on the ground. On
July 5, Colonel Brant and fifty Indians
arrived at Fort Erie from the Maumee to
meet and interview the American commissioners.
This delegation alleged that the
warlike actions of General Wayne had prevented
the meeting at the rapids and
inquired specifically whether or not the
commissioners were properly authorized to
run a new boundary line. Before this
advanced deputation returned it was clear
that the Indians would refuse to recognize
any treaty made since the famous Stanwix
treaty of 1768.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> By their instructions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the commissioners<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> were ordered to insist
upon the boundaries established at the
Treaty of Fort Harmar.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> From the beginning,
despite the liberality of the offers of
the United States&mdash;trading-posts north of
the Ludlow Line to be evacuated and fifty
thousand dollars to be paid to settle any
miscellaneous claims by Indians not benefited
in previous treaties&mdash;there was no
hope of reconciliation. In fact there was
no agreement even among the &ldquo;hostile&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;peaceful&rdquo; nations at Roche de
Bout. The delegates from the Six Nations
did not agree with the ill-disposed councils
of the embittered Shawanese and Miami
warriors and were not advised of the final
decision of the council. The American
commissioners were ever held off at arm&rsquo;s
length. On the twenty-first of July they
reached the mouth of the Detroit River,
and took quarters with Captain Matthew
Elliott. From this point communications
passed to and fro between the real convention
at Roche de Bout and the Americans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
fifty miles away. The last message from
the Indians was sent August 13. Its important
paragraph read: &ldquo;At our general
council, held at the Glaize last fall, we
agreed to meet commissioners from the
United States, for the purpose of restoring
peace, provided they consented to acknowledge
and confirm our boundary line to be
the Ohio: and we determined not to meet
you, until you gave us satisfaction on that
point: that is the reason we have never
met.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> On the sixteenth day of August
the commissioners replied that the above
message was a virtual declaration of war,
and declared that &ldquo;impartial judges will
not attribute the continuance of the war to
them.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>A glimpse into the council of Indians at
the rapids is afforded us in the deposition
made by an unknown Pennsylvanian youth,
who was captured by Wea Indians in 1783
and who had lived among the Indians
throughout the ten years since that time.
He attended the treaty. On the tenth of
July there were fourteen hundred Indians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
present; on the twentieth, twenty-four
hundred. Of these, eighteen hundred were
warriors. It was unanimously agreed that
the Ohio should be made the boundary line
and that the Indians be paid for Kentucky.
Simon Girty, Governor Simcoe&rsquo;s aide-de-camp,
a Lieutenant Silvy of the Fifth (British)
Regiment, and another British officer
remained at Colonel McKee&rsquo;s house, which
was fifty yards distant from the council
fire.</p>

<p>In the evenings the head chiefs, especially
those of the Shawanese and Delaware
nations, met with Colonel McKee and his
guests. &ldquo;McKee always promised that the
King, their Father, would protect them &amp;
afford them every thing they wanted in
case they went to war.... Advise that
they ought not to make Peace upon any
other terms than to make the Ohio the
boundary line. After the final decision,
McKee furnished the savages with arms,
ammunition, scalping knives and Tomahawks
even more than they could use this
winter.&rdquo; On the twenty-eighth of July
the Indians separated to reassemble &ldquo;at
au-Glaize twenty-four days from that time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>&rdquo;
to watch Wayne and attack him if opportunity
offered.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Instantly a score of Indian runners were
hurrying south and east to Knox and
Wayne with the secret code message to
prepare for war.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The exact date of
Wayne&rsquo;s receipt of this message (sent from
Niagara, August 23) is not recorded. It
was two hours after midnight, September
24, when the express thundered into
Petersburg, Kentucky, with an order to
General Scott &ldquo;to take the field with the
Mounted Volunteers &amp; to be at Fort Jefferson
By the first of October.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Hobson&rsquo;s
Choice was the scene of intense activity as
September drew to a close, and by October
5 all was in readiness for the northward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
movement. Excluding invalids, and garrisons
to be left at the four forts on the line
of march, Wayne estimated his available
force at twenty-six hundred regulars and
three hundred and sixty mounted volunteers.
&ldquo;...  you may rest assured,&rdquo;
Wayne wrote Knox upon leaving Fort
Washington, &ldquo;that I will not commit the
legion [risk an engagement] unnecessarily;
and unless more powerfully supported ...
I will content myself by taking a strong
position advanced of [Fort] Jefferson, and
by exerting every power, endeavor to protect
the frontiers, and to secure the posts
and army during the winter.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Already the far-sighted Wayne had anticipated
the matter of road-building, an
important department of a pioneer general&rsquo;s
duty in which he particularly excelled. As
early as July 10, the American commissioners
to the hostile tribes wrote Secretary
Knox that the Indian scouts reported that
Wayne &ldquo;has cut and cleared a road, straight
from fort Washington, into the Indian
country, in a direction that would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
missed fort Jefferson; but that, meeting
with a large swamp, it was, of necessity,
turned to that fort, and then continued six
miles beyond it.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The very fact that
when Wayne left Fort Washington, October
7, he covered the seventy-five odd miles to
the site of Fort Greenville (Greenville,
Ohio) in six days is proof enough that the
Indians&rsquo; spies were well within the mark
in saying that a road had been built; more
than that, packhorses had been wearing it
deep into the ground with heavy loads of
food for mouths and guns, and large droves
of cattle had already rough-stamped
Wayne&rsquo;s Trace from the Ohio to the Stillwater.
Faithful James O&rsquo;Hara was quartermaster
and Elliott and Williams the contractors.
Colonel Robert Elliott, a native
of Hagerstown, Pennsylvania, met his death
at the hands of the savages at the &ldquo;bigg
hill&rdquo; near Fort Jefferson while engaged in
hurrying on provisions to the northern
posts. &ldquo;Mr Elliott had on a wig,&rdquo; records
General Posey in a strain of gloomy
defiance, &ldquo;the indians will not get his
skulp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mad Anthony Street, in Cincinnati, is the
beginning of Wayne&rsquo;s Road northward up
Mill Creek Valley, thence running northwest
to Fort Hamilton on the watershed
south of the head branches of the West
Fork. The route through Hamilton is
given by Everts as across the sites of
Snider&rsquo;s paper-mill, Niles tool works, and
Cape and Maxwell&rsquo;s plant.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The old track
crossed the Miami a few rods south of the
eastern end of the High Street bridge and
from there circled around the west end of
what is locally known as the &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Backbone&rdquo;
on what was L. D. Campbell&rsquo;s
peninsula but which is now an island.
Wayne&rsquo;s first camp was at Five Mile Spring,
southeast of the village of Five Mile. The
old route passed over the present site of
that village and kept on the eastern side of
Seven Mile Creek all the way to Fort St.
Clair (Eaton, Preble County). Two Mile,
Four Mile, Seven Mile, and Nine Mile
Creeks were all so named from Wayne&rsquo;s
crossing-places. Following up the valley
of Seven Mile about two miles, the old
track leaves it near Nine Mile Creek and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
turns due north, leaving Butler County in
Wayne Township, section 6. In Preble
County the &ldquo;south end&rdquo; of Wayne&rsquo;s Trace
has always been used as a highway and
known as &ldquo;Wayne&rsquo;s Trace Road.&rdquo; The
trace passes through Washington Township
east of Eaton, crossing the Greenville Road
on a bluff near a sycamore-tree on the east
side of the road. It crossed Banta&rsquo;s Fork
at or near the &ldquo;Forty-foot Pitch&rdquo; and
ascended the high bank at a point on the
east side of the present road. The swamp
which the Indian spies said had turned
Wayne&rsquo;s route nearer Fort Jefferson than
was originally intended evidently lay in
the vicinity of Ithaca, Twin Township,
Darke County. The first settler in Brown

clearing beside Wayne&rsquo;s Trace on the farm

parts the explorer will find the famous old
track partially marked out by the growths
of young sycamores which sprang up here
when the forests were cut down. Many of

<p class="center">[<i>From the original in the library of Harvard University</i>]</p>
</div>


<p>A happy interest attaches to an old route
like Wayne&rsquo;s, from the very fact that the
labor spent in hewing it out and in transporting
over it vast quantities of provisions
and ammunition was not expended in vain.
Wayne&rsquo;s Road, like Forbes&rsquo;s route across
the Alleghenies, led to victory; the dark
winding tracks of the armies of Braddock
and St. Clair possess a romantic element
that is fascinating in the extreme, but
wholly unsatisfactory. There is an inspiration
in following the rough tracks of men
who won which is not found in the paths
of men who, after struggles perhaps more
heroic because facing greater odds, failed.
Wayne was a thousand times better
equipped for his campaign than was St.
Clair. Before his campaign, the savage
war was not taken very seriously. Now
proper preparations had been made, approximately
sufficient stores accumulated,
the official personnel sifted down; and as
the &ldquo;Legion of the United States&rdquo; went
swiftly forward in the October sunlight of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
that Indian summer, there was a sane consciousness
of preparedness and power which
was all but victory. The Indians were
quick to recognize and describe, in their
figurative way, the two chief characteristics
of Wayne as a frontier commander&mdash;he
was both the &ldquo;Black Snake&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Whirlwind.&rdquo; When in motion, he swept
through the forests like a cyclone; the
record of no pioneer army in America
equals the marching records of Wayne&rsquo;s
Legion. It was a standing order that every
march should be under high pressure and
that no break or interruption should in any
case delay the movement of the main body
a single moment. This impressed the savages
tremendously; they had known no
such army as this&mdash;which advanced into
their country almost as fast as others had
run out of it. Thus they talked of the
&ldquo;Whirlwind&rdquo; around their northern fires.
Wayne, too, was a &ldquo;Black Snake.&rdquo; He
was as cunning as he was impetuous. As
will be seen, he built roads he never traversed,
doubled his track, and over and again
completely outwitted the astonished Indian
spies that attempted, with sharp eyes in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the brown leaves, to fathom his purposes.</p>

<p>The lateness of the season prevented a
more elaborate campaign than Wayne had
suggested to the Secretary of War. The
army swept northward to Greenville Creek
and on the present site of Greenville, Ohio,
erected Fort Greenville&mdash;named by Wayne
in honor of his dead friend General Nathaniel
Greene of Revolutionary fame. By
November 16, Posey records, all the houses
were completed and once more the drilling
and man&#339;uvering began. We have it
under the hand of the same authority that
General Wayne affirmed that never in the
Revolutionary War had he commanded
such well-drilled troops as these which
spent the winter with him buried deep in
those Ohio forests. It is sure that a general
never needed well-drilled soldiers more;
and no less sure that no troops needed
encouragement more than these. There
were, however, the bright sides to life even
here. Though coffee was a dollar and
brown sugar seventy-five cents a pound,
and whiskey five dollars a gallon, yet there
was good cheer and merrymaking. A battery
was built for the officers to play &ldquo;fiver,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>&rdquo;
of which the younger men became very
fond. On one evening the veteran General
Scott entertained the officers in his apartments
and was drawn out to tell of pioneer
Kentucky in whose battles he had displayed
so much courage and lost his three sons.
&ldquo;He told us how Col<sup>o</sup> Boon first discovered
Kentucky,&rdquo; wrote Posey; &ldquo;&lsquo;Col<sup>o</sup> Boon was
a very enterprizing, smart man,&rsquo; said General
Scott, &lsquo;but very whimsical.&rsquo;&rdquo; There
were frequent scouting expeditions in which
the whole garrison was interested. On one
occasion Wells&rsquo;s audacious rangers fell
upon three Indians at their midday repast;
one of the three in the pursuit was compelled
to leap into a creek and when he
&ldquo;came up&rdquo; he was found to be a white
man, Christopher Miller. His life being
saved, he renounced the wild career, visited
his aged parents in Kentucky, and then
returned to become one of Wayne&rsquo;s most
successful spies. No doubt the soldiers
laughed at this transformation of a red into
a white man, and perhaps swore that if
other Indians were dowsed equally well they
would be found to be equally white and to
be wearing British uniforms!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>There was one duty that fell now to
Wayne that was not congenial. Posey was
one of the detachment which pushed forward
in the December snow to St. Clair&rsquo;s
slaughter-ground and erected there the
most advanced of the chain of forts between
the Ohio and Maumee. As the company
neared the spot, Captain Edward Butler
touched Posey on the shoulder and said:
&ldquo;When you reach the ground go to a large
spreading oak which you cannot fail to see.
Under that oak my brother&rsquo;s marquee was
pitched and there you will find his bones
which you can identify by a fracture of one
thigh bone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We went to the place,&rdquo; writes Posey,
&ldquo;and found part of his [General Richard
Butler&rsquo;s] bones, his skull and both thy
bones, one we discovered had been
broken.... We collected all the bones
and laid them in one Pile, on every skul
bone you might see the mark of the skulping
knife a round every skul bone.&rdquo; The
pieces of guns&mdash;many barrels bent double
by fiendish Indians&mdash;were collected, and
four cannon were discovered just where an
Indian prisoner had said they would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
found. A strong fort was built and very
appropriately named Fort Recovery, Captain
Alexander Gibson commanding the
garrison. On the sixth day, a portion of
the party returned to Fort Greenville. The
erection of Fort Recovery was another leap
toward the Maumee and soon Indians began
to arrive at Fort Greenville bearing
white flags and talking of an armistice and
peace. Wayne, obeying orders from the
Secretary to end the war without another
campaign if possible, received the emissaries
as though he believed their lying r&ocirc;le.
Deceived by Wayne&rsquo;s attitude, one of the
Allegheny chiefs, Big Tree, committed
suicide. He had sworn to kill three hostile
Indians to avenge the death of his &ldquo;very
dear friend&rdquo; General Butler; exasperated
at the hint of peace he made way with
himself.</p>

<p>The peace emissaries, and all talk of an
armistice, faded with the winter snows, and
by early summer every plan for the crucial
campaign had been made both by the Indians
and by Wayne. It was July before
Scott&rsquo;s fifteen hundred mounted volunteers
arrived at Greenville. Already one bloody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
skirmish had taken place near the walls of
Fort Recovery in which near a thousand Indians
had participated. Large quantities of
stores had been forwarded to Greenville and
Fort Recovery, and the grand advance on
the Maumee was on the eve of starting. Of
this campaign we have Lieutenant Boyer&rsquo;s
official narrative,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> supplemented by the
slight records of Posey and Lieutenant
William Clark, a brother of George Rogers
Clark.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning of July
28 Wayne with two thousand regulars and
fifteen hundred mounted volunteers set out
for the Maumee Valley from Fort Greenville.
The route followed by St. Clair and
used during the winter by the Fort Recovery
garrison was the course pursued, and
camp was pitched in the afternoon on Still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>water
Creek after a twelve-mile march.
The next day the army was off before sunrise;
we &ldquo;pushed forward without regard
to bag or baggage,&rdquo; records Clark, &ldquo;as if
not in search, but in actual pursuit of a
flying &amp; disorderly enemy.&rdquo; Fort Recovery
was reached at noon and the army camped
a mile beyond. On the day following the
army crashed onward, following the winding
stream called a tributary of the &ldquo;St.
Mary&rsquo;s&rdquo; by St. Clair, but which was in fact
the head of the Wabash. Clark says the
stream was crossed &ldquo;more than a dozen
times&rdquo; and &ldquo;Camp Beaver Swamp&rdquo; was
pitched where the stream was found to be
impassable, eleven miles from Fort Recovery.
Much of the journey today had been
through wide prairies covered with nettles,
the water unfit to drink and mosquitoes,
&ldquo;larger than I ever saw,&rdquo; observed Boyer.
Today the road was opened as the army
advanced and the route was up the Wabash
from the present village of Fort Recovery,
Mercer County, Ohio.</p>

<p>The construction of a bridge at Camp
Beaver Swamp seventy yards in length
delayed the army one day but enabled the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
road-cutters to hew a way through to the
St. Mary River.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> On August 1, the army
pressed on over the backbone of Ohio and
down the northern slope into the basin of
the Maumee River, and encamped beside
the famous little St. Mary River. Today,
emerging suddenly from the vast stretch of
nettles and brush that grew in the swampy
district, the army suddenly drew out into a
beautiful level meadow, every corps of the
army having the first view of all the other
divisions. This day Clark affirms that the
army crossed the trace followed by General
Harmar in 1790 to the Miami village.
Tonight the army encamped by the St.
Mary and on the morrow the erection of
what was first called Fort Randolph and
later Fort Adams was begun.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> This was
the seventh fortified post in the chain from
the Ohio and was located on the south bank
of the St. Mary, four miles above Rockford<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
(the old Shane&rsquo;s Crossings), Mercer County,
Ohio.</p>

<p>On the fourth the army hurried on about
eleven miles to &ldquo;a small, dirty water,&rdquo; as
Clark described it, &ldquo;a branch of the Glaize
[Auglaize] River,&rdquo; where camp was fortified
for the night. The day after, a march of
equal length &ldquo;down the creek&rdquo; to the
camp described by Boyer as &ldquo;Camp forty-four
miles in advance of Fort Recovery.&rdquo;
Wayne&rsquo;s camps were each proof against
insult from the enemy, which accounts for
his encamping early each afternoon. On
the afternoon of August 6, the army reached
the banks of the celebrated &ldquo;Glaize,&rdquo; the
Auglaize River. Here, according to Posey,
a stronger encampment than usual was
built, named Fort Loramie.</p>

<p>As the Maumee was neared the feeling
of the army was intense. While at Fort
Adams, Wayne had made feints at cutting
two roads, one down the St. Mary River
and another northwest straight toward
Roche de Bout. These routes were both
opened for some distance, that down the
St. Mary at least as far as the famous ford
at Shane&rsquo;s Crossing&mdash;the present Rock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>ford.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
That the Indian spies would report
the building of these roads, there was no
doubt. But when on August 4 the swift
advance was renewed neither road was followed!
A straight course northward into
the Auglaize Valley was taken&mdash;a route
that could not have been pursued in any
but the driest weather. It ran northward
from Fort Adams, probably near the Fort
Jennings of the War of 1812, situated
on the left bank of the Auglaize in the
northwest part of Jennings Township,
Putnam County, Ohio. Thence the route
was straight down the Auglaize in general
alignment with the present Defiance
Road.</p>

<p>Wayne&rsquo;s tactics in road-building as he
neared the enemy&rsquo;s villages is perhaps quite
unparalleled; indeed, as will be emphasized,
this remarkable campaign was not less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
impressive to the savages&mdash;these swift
plunges through the forests, the sudden
pauses and the astonishing feints&mdash;than
was the battle which soon crushed the
Indian confederacy. At the same time the
careful historian would greatly err should
he not give Wayne credit for obeying, even
now, the earnest commands of his superiors
to secure an armistice and a peace without
a battle. Secretary Knox had, over and
again, urged Wayne to secure peace without
bloodshed if possible. A battle in any
case was hazardous; there were possibilities
of defeat; there were greater promises of
a continuous war even in case of an American
victory. The British had displayed
characteristic arrogance in building a fort
at Roche de Bout this very spring, around
which the Indian cohorts were probably
gathering. Complications with England
were undoubtedly possible, if not entirely
probable. From Lieutenant Clark&rsquo;s journal
it is clear that General Wilkinson
proposed, as soon as the Auglaize was
reached, to make a dash with a flying
column upon the populous district at the
junction of the Auglaize with the Maumee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Wayne refused to consider the plan<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>&mdash;and
throughout the remainder of Clark&rsquo;s journal
his words are well-nigh abusive of
General Wayne&rsquo;s whole management of
the campaign.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The dare-devil Wayne&rsquo;s
caution at this strategic juncture of this
important campaign portrays an element of
steadiness for which the hero of Stony
Point has perhaps never received sufficient
credit.</p>

<p>On the eighth of August, after marching
through five miles of cornfields, where were
&ldquo;vegetables of every kind in abundance,&rdquo;
according to Boyer, the tired Legion came
in view of the Maumee, of which they and
a whole nation had heard so much. The spot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
of encampment was the site of the present
city of Defiance on the commanding point
between the rivers, and here in the three
days succeeding, Fort Defiance was erected.
To the Indians the name of the spot was
Grand Glaize.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Wells&rsquo;s rangers reported
that the Indian army was lying two miles
above the British fort, on the west bank of
the Maumee. According to Posey, Wayne
on the eleventh despatched an old Indian to
the hostile camp with offers of peace; two
days later an old squaw was posted off with
a similar message. Neither returned. On
the sixteenth, the fort being nearly completed,
Major Hunt was left in command,
and the grand advance began. The route
was down the left bank of the Maumee
straight toward the painted lines of Little
Turtle&rsquo;s army. Christopher Miller&mdash;the
red-man made white by that plunge in the
creek&mdash;met the army today with a message
from the chieftain White Eyes, Clark records,
asking Wayne to remain ten days at
Grand Glaize, not erecting a fort, and the
Indians would perhaps treat with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
&ldquo;This letter,&rdquo; Lieutenant Clark states,
&ldquo;was generally considered as a challenge.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>Nineteen miles was made the first day
(August 16) and twelve the day following.
As the road was &ldquo;generally bad,&rdquo; as Boyer
affirms, these tremendous marches must be
considered remarkable, for each camp was
heavily fortified and the enemy was just at
hand. The spies in advance were unceasing
in their vigilance and activity; and on
the eighteenth poor May, who had lived
with the Indians as a spy the preceding
winter at Wayne&rsquo;s command, was entrapped
and captured, suffering a most cruel death.
This day the army encamped forty-one
miles from Fort Defiance and made a strong
entrenchment which was named Fort
Deposit. Here the heavy baggage was
stored that the troops might go into action
unencumbered.</p>

<p>On the twentieth, at seven in the morning,
the Legion advanced in fighting order.
The Indian army, its left wing lying on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Presque Isle, was stretched across the
valley for two miles in a well-chosen position.
A tornado had swept the forest here
and the mass of fallen trees offered a particularly
advantageous spot for the Indians&rsquo;
favorite method of fighting. Such spots
were very common in the old Black Forest
of the West and were generally known as
&ldquo;fallen timber&rdquo; by the Indians and
pioneers;<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> in them cavalry was almost
useless. Thus the mounted volunteers, the
Indians believed, would be debarred from
the fight.</p>

<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock the advanced lines met.
At the first burst of sudden flame the
American vanguard of volunteers was staggered,
perhaps surprised at the fire from an
unseen enemy lying beneath the tangled
wind-rack of the forest. The guards on
the right fell back through the regulars
commanded by Cook and Steele. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
regulars were thrown into confusion. It
was fifteen minutes before order was
restored but when joined by the riflemen
and legionary cavalry, a charge with trailed
arms was ordered and the savages were
pricked out from their lairs with the point
of the bayonet. A heavy firing on the left
announced that the battle now was raging
there, but only for a moment. The whole
Indian plan of battle was destroyed by the
impetuous bayonet charges of troops hard-drilled
in the dull days at Legionville,
Hobson&rsquo;s Choice, and in the snows of
Greenville. The redskins hid where a
tornado had passed&mdash;not expecting another
more destructive than the first! For two
miles the scattering horde was pursued
headlong through the forests. A halt was
ordered just within sight of the British
fort, whose guns were silent though menacing.
The Indians poured on down the
valley toward the present site of Toledo
and Lake Erie.</p>

<p>The battle of Fallen Timber was a decisive
and important victory. The Indians
numbered about fifteen hundred; a considerable
number of advancing allies never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
reached the battle-ground. The rapid
strides of Wayne had forced the meeting
unexpectedly. Those ten days the Indians
had requested for conference would have
largely increased their strength. The
number killed and wounded on either side
was inconsiderable; forty Indians, only,
were found on the two-mile field of conflict.
Twenty-six killed and eighty-seven
wounded, was the Legion&rsquo;s loss. Of the
Kentuckians, who hardly got into the
action on account of the swift success of
the Legion, seven privates were killed,
and ten privates and three officers were
wounded.</p>

<p>Remaining three days on the battle-field,
Wayne destroyed many acres of corn and
many Indian huts and then returned to
Fort Defiance. Thence he ascended the
Maumee to the junction of the St. Mary
and St. Joseph&mdash;Harmar&rsquo;s battle ground&mdash;and
built a fort which he permitted the
oldest officer (Posey?) to name &ldquo;Fort
Wayne in honor of the hero of Stony
Point.&rdquo; From Fort Wayne the army
ascended the St. Mary to Fort Adams, and
thence passed to Loramie&rsquo;s, where a new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Fort Loramie was erected. The troops
from there opened a new route across to
Fort Greenville. Here, in the following
year, the awed and broken Indian nations
signed the Treaty of Fort Greenville which
practically reaffirmed the previous Treaty of
Fort Harmar.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Viewed as a whole, Wayne&rsquo;s campaign
is most interesting from the standpoint of
road-building. It was Wayne&rsquo;s advance
which awed the savages, not the battle of
Fallen Timber. The army crashing northward
through the forests as though ever in
the pursuit of a foe, the impregnable forts
that arose here and there, the strongly
fortified camps, the fleet and active scouting
parties, the stern but even temper of
Wayne&rsquo;s exhortations for peace, and at
last, the fierce bayonet charge amid the
prostrate trees, accomplished the very mission
of the hour. That winding line of a
road from the Ohio to Roche de Bout, and
the five new forts that sprang up on it in
1793 and 1794, have left their impress
strongly upon western history. The Indians
never forgot the &ldquo;Whirlwind,&rdquo; who was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
also a &ldquo;Black Snake.&rdquo; Since that road
was built, the Indian race has never been
a national menace. Bloody battles there
have been, but at no time has the expansion
of the United States been seriously
jeopardized by Indian hostility.</p>

<p>Clark&rsquo;s conquest of Vincennes was now
made good by the conquest of the Maumee
Valley; Harmar&rsquo;s reverses and St. Clair&rsquo;s
annihilation were avenged&mdash;the Old Northwest
was won.</p>

REFER TO THE MARCH TO KASKASKIA</h3>


<p>&ldquo;... on the [24th] of June 1778 we
left our Little Island and Run about a mile
up the River in order to gain the main
Channel and shot the Falls at the very
moment of the sun being in a great Eclipse
which caused Various conjectures among
the superstitious as I knew that spies were
kept on the River below the Towns of the
Illinois I had resolved to march part of the
way by Land and of course left the whole
of our baggage, except as much as would
equip us in the Indian mode. The whole
of our force, after leaving such as was
Judged not competent to the expected
fatiegue, Consisted only of four companies,
commanded by Captns Jno. Montgomery,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
J. Bowman, L. Helm, and W. Harrod my
force being so small to what I expected
owing to the various circumstances already
mentioned I found it necessary to alter my
plans of operations, as post St. Vincent at
this time was a Town of considerable force
consisting of near four Hundred militia
with an Indian Town adjoining and great
numbers continually in the Neighborhood,
and in the scale of Indian affairs of More
Importance than any other. [I] had thought
of attacking it first but now found that I
could by no means venture near it Resolved
to begin my career in the Illinois
where there was more Inhabitants but scattered
in different Villages, and less danger
of being immediately overpowered by the
Indians, and in case of necessity, [we could]
probably make our retreat good to the
Spanish side of the Mississippi, but if Successful
here [we] might pave our way to
the possession of Post St. Vincent....
As I intended to leave the Ohio at Ft.
Massiac 3 leagues below the Tennessee I
landed on Barritaria a small island in the
mouth of that River in order to prepare for
the march ... having every thing pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>pared
we moved down to a little gul[ley]
a small distance above Massiac in which we
concealed our Boats and set out a Northwest
course, nothing remarkable on this
rout, the weather was favorable, in some
parts water scarce as well as game, of
course we suffered drought and Hunger but
not [to] excess, on the third Day, John Saunders,
our principal guide, appeared confused
we soon discovered that he was totally lost
without there was some other cause of his
present conduct I asked him various question,
and from his answers I could scarcely
determine what to think of him, whether
or not he was sensible that he was lost the
thought of which [?] or that he wished to
deceive us the cry of the whole Detachment
was that he was a Traitor, he beged that he
might be suffered to go some distance into
a plain that was in full view to try to make
some discovery whether or not he was
right. I told him he might but that I was
suppitious [suspicious] of him from his
conduct that from the first of his being
employed always said that he knew the way
well that there was now a different appearance
that I saw the nature of the Cuntry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
was such that a person once acquainted with
it could not in a short time forget it that a
few men should go with him to prevent his
escape&mdash;and that if he did not discover and
take us into <i>the Hunters Road</i> that lead from
the East into Kaskaskia that he had frequently
described that I would have him
Immediately put to death which I was
determined to have done, but after an Hour
or two&rsquo;s search he came to a place that he
perfectly knew and we discovered that the
poor fellow had been as they call it bewildered.
On the eavining of the fourth of
July we got with in a few miles of the
Town.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF CLARK&rsquo;S PLACE<br />
OF CROSSING THE &ldquo;TWO WABASHES&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></h3>


<p>Mr. Draper founds his conclusion that
the &ldquo;two Wabashes&rdquo; were the Little
Wabash and the Fox wholly on present-day
(1878-90) reports<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> of the nature of
the country at the Little Wabash above the
mouth of the Fox and above the mouth of
the Big Muddy. The reports he received
from residents of the neighborhoods carry
evidence that the ground between the Little
Wabash and Fox most nearly agrees with
Clark&rsquo;s and Bowman&rsquo;s descriptions of the
crossing-place.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> This is true, and is of
importance. But Clark&rsquo;s and Bowman&rsquo;s
use of the word &ldquo;heights&rdquo; was merely
relative; Mr. Draper&rsquo;s correspondents speak
of high grounds and low grounds as the land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
lies today. With water but three or four
feet deep, a few acres of land might have
been uncovered, though not sufficiently
elevated today to be termed a hill or even
high ground. There is a point on the
Little &mdash;abash above the mouth of the Fox
that can be made to answer in a general
way Clark&rsquo;s and Bowman&rsquo;s descriptions&mdash;going
on the doubtful supposition that their
descriptions were entirely accurate. In
order to find a spot where Clark saw nearly
five miles of water before him, Mr. Draper
suggests a point about two miles above the
mouth of the Fox, where there is a wide
bottom on the west of the Little &mdash;abash,
another bottom between that stream and
the Fox, and another east of the Fox.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
The possibility that the distance was exaggerated
by Clark (who said Vincennes was
two hundred and forty miles from Kaskaskia
when it was not over one hundred and
seventy-five) is not considered. As a matter
of fact, the whole plan of finding today
five miles of low ground from any point
west of the Little &mdash;abash to the east of
either the Fox or the Big Muddy, is over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>thrown
by Clark&rsquo;s statement in the <i>Memoir</i>
that (on the western side of the Little Wabash)
&ldquo;we formed a camp on a height
which we found on the bank of the river.&rdquo;
Mr. Draper&rsquo;s objection to the Little
Wabash and Big Muddy crossing-place
was because the high ground on the bank
of the Little Wabash (seemingly here
referred to by Clark) prevented there being
five miles of low ground to the opposite
side of the Big Muddy.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> If Clark and
Bowman gave the distance of width of water
correctly, the crossing-place was two miles
above the mouth of the Fox, and Clark&rsquo;s
statement of forming a camp on a height on
the river bank is totally inexplicable&mdash;for
there is no height at this point to answer
such a description. If, by &ldquo;nearly&rdquo; five
miles, Clark meant three miles, misjudging
distance on water inversely with
the usual way, his camp could have
been on the immediate high bank of the
Little Wabash above the mouth of the Big
Muddy.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>Certain other considerations have a ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>dency
to influence the present writer in
believing that the crossing-place was here&mdash;above
the mouth of the Big Muddy. It
was exceedingly wet from the day Clark
left Kaskaskia; even on the watersheds he
found deep standing water. On reaching
the Petit Fork he found the rivers at flood-tide.
By turning north to the Clay County
route he would strike the Little Wabash at
a more northerly point, and would almost
completely head the deep little Bonpas
which lay between the Fox and the Big
Wabash. The Clay County route was in one
sense, then, a watershed route, compared
with the Wayne County route. It is difficult
to believe that Clark&rsquo;s guides would
ignore this after having been compelled to
cross the Petit Fork on felled trees. Again,
on the second day out from the crossing-place
of the Little Wabash, Bowman records:
&ldquo;16th. Marched all day through rain
and water; crossed Fox river.&rdquo; If this
entry is correct, of course the Little Wabash
and Big Muddy crossing-place is completely
established. Mr. Draper, holding that the
Fox was crossed simultaneously with the
Little Wabash on the fifteenth, suggests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
that Bowman meant Bonpas for Fox.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
Choosing between possible errors, the present
writer finds it easier to believe that
Bowman misjudged the width of water
crossed on the fifteenth, than that he called
the Bonpas the Fox. For on the seventeenth
the heads of the Bonpas are specifically
accounted for by Bowman as follows:
&ldquo;17th. Marched early; crossed several runs,
very deep.&rdquo; Mr. Draper does not account
for these, and it is difficult to do so if they
were not the heads of the Bonpas. For, if
Clark crossed the Little Wabash just above
the mouth of the Fox, his route, after
crossing the Bonpas, was northeast, and
would, without any sort of question, have
been on watersheds between little tributaries,
first of the Bonpas, and then of the
Embarras. Again, by every account, it is
sure Clark and Bowman expected to strike
the Embarras, and strike it at about seven
or eight miles due west from Vincennes.
If, as Draper believed, they were pursuing
an old trail, which, it is well known,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> ran
from the crossing-place of the Little Wabash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
two miles above the mouth of the Fox to
the Wabash just below the mouth of the
Embarras, how can it be explained that the
army reached, or ever intended to reach,
the Embarras seven or eight miles above
its mouth? The very name would warn
them away and it seems highly improbable
that, if what was later known as the southern
route was traversed, the army would
ever have seen the Embarras.</p>

The Indians charged on Hardins troops
having no other Chance to Escape Hardins
troops give way and retreated the Same
way They went out and was not in That
Battle any more. Some of the Troops
informed me That Major Fountain was
Living when our Troops Drove the Indians

of Kentucky Collected The Troops and
Tarried on The Battle Ground untill They
Indians had entirely Disappeared and not

what was the Number of our Troops

Though it was Considerable my oppinion
is There was more Indians Killed in That
Battle Than was Killed when Gen<sup>l</sup> &mdash;ayne
defeated Them in 1794 if Harmar had Sent
out a Detachment of Six hundred men Next
Day to Collected The Dead and Buried

Never agree That Harmars Campaing was

route and march are: the Journal of Captain John
Armstrong, of the Regulars (Dillon&rsquo;s <i>History of Indiana</i>,
pp. 245-248); Thomas Irwin&rsquo;s account of Harmar&rsquo;s
and St. Clair&rsquo;s campaigns, in the <i>Draper MSS.</i>, iv U,
fols. 3-17; Hugh Scott&rsquo;s Narrative, <i>Id.</i>, fol. 99, and
David H. Morris&rsquo;s Narrative, in the Troy (Ohio) <i>Times</i>
of January 29, 1840. Hereafter these will be referred
to by name only. Harmar&rsquo;s route out of Cincinnati is
thus described by J. G. Olden in his <i>Historical Sketches
and Early Reminiscences of Hamilton County, Ohio</i>:
&ldquo;Moved from Ft. Washington up the little ravine that
runs into Deer Creek near what is now the head of Sycamore
street, Cincinnati, thence through Mt. Auburn and
along the general course of what is now the Reading
turnpike to the little stream since known as Ross run
where he encamped for the night in what is now Section
4 Mill creek township near where Four Mile tavern was
built. The next day he moved, still on Clark&rsquo;s old trace,
now Reading turnpike, passing near where the school-house
now stands in Reading, thence on to the little run
east of where Sharonville now is, where he encamped
for the [second] night.&rdquo;</p></div>

expeditions had gone northward from the present site of
Cincinnati before Harmar&rsquo;s: Bowman in 1779, Clark in
1780, and Clark again in 1782. In 1782 Clark passed
northward on the watershed between the Miamis. It
was therefore Clark&rsquo;s route of 1780 which Harmar&rsquo;s
militia followed.</p></div>

says: &ldquo;Main street, beyond Seventh, was a mere road
nearly impassable in muddy weather which, at the foot
of the hills, divided into two, called the Hamilton and
the Mad-river road. The former took the course of the
Brighton House; the latter made a steep ascent over
Mount Auburn.&rdquo;

Armstrong&rsquo;s makes the first ten miles of the third day in
a northwest course. Even if this be understood as
meaning west of north, it would take the army to the
west of West Chester in Butler County. If we assume
northwest to be an error for northeast, &lsquo;the first five
miles over a dry ridge to a lick&rsquo; would bring the army
to the lick at Lick School-house in Deerfield township,
Warren county; and the next &lsquo;five miles through a low
swampy country to a branch of the waters of the Little
Miami&rsquo; would be over the swampy land of early times
in the vicinity of Mason, and there is a tradition that
the army stopped for a time on Little Muddy creek, on
the farm formerly owned by Joseph McClung, north of
Mason.&rdquo;</p></div>

follows: &ldquo;Forty-five thousand rations of provisions
should move with the army; ... twice in every ten
days forty-five thousand rations should move from Fort
Washington to the next post, until three hundred and
sixty thousand rations were sent forward; ... forty-five
thousand rations should again move with the army
from the first post to a second, and an equal number
twice in every ten days until the residue of the three
hundred and sixty thousand were carried forward, and
so on from post to post, still moving with forty-five thousand
rations. They have failed entirely in enabling me
to move with forty-five thousand rations, and from the
letter above mentioned, the agent seems not to expect
to move any beyond this place; for he says: &lsquo;If you
move from thence (meaning this place) shortly, and take
ten days&rsquo; provisions with you, it will deprive us of the
means to transport what may be necessary after that is
exhausted.&rsquo; After, then, that you know <i>exactly</i> what
the contractors can do as to transportation, (for so far
as they can do it, it is their business, and must not be
taken out of their hands) you will take your measures
so, as that, on the 27th instant, I may be able to move
with three hundred horse-loads of flour, and that one
hundred and fifty horse-loads succeed that every seven
days; one hundred and fifty horses being sent back
every seven days. For whatever expense may attend
the arrangement, this shall be your warrant; and I am
certain, from your personal character, as well as from
your zeal for the public good, that no unnecessary expense
will be incurred. It is to be observed, that our
beef will be expended about the 5th or 6th of next
month. When I left Fort Washington, the agent of the
contractors informed me that he expected a drove of
cattle very soon; whether they are arrived or not I am
not informed. I have written to him on this occasion;
but I request you to inform yourself, and, if necessary,
to make provision there also; and, indeed, there is not
a moment to lose about it, and to provide for any deficiency.
He writes me that the measures he has taken
will give a supply to the last of December or a month
